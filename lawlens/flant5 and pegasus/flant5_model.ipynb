      "Sample Summary: The issue whether a company involved in arbitration proceedings may continue the arbitration proceedings even after CIRP has been been approved by COC of the company was considered by the division bench of Supreme Court consisting of Justice AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheswari in the matters between  Fourth Dimension Solutions Ltd. v. Ricoh India Ltd. Civil Appeal No. –5908 of 2021 decided on 21.1.2022. The facts of this are defendant Ricoh owed the appellant Rs.511 crores. It is stated that NCLT has approved a resolution plan that dismisses the appellant’s (Fourth Dimension Solutions Ltd.) claims, even though the appellant is the highest operational creditor of the respondent company Ricoh India. The Supreme Court also upheld the resolution plan, despite the appellant’s objection that the same decision was pending before NCLAT. However, while the higher court approved the plan, it directed NCLAT to decide on the merits of appellant’s objection to the substantive resolution plan. Despite this, NCLAT said it would be impossible for the court to do so, as the Supreme Court approved the resolution plan. The NCLAT took a contrary position and rejected the appellant’s objection to the resolution plan. Thus forcing the appellant approached the Supreme Court. The counsel on behalf of the Appellant contended  that they would be left with no “recourse to satisfy his legitimate claims” even though it is the highest operational creditor and has Rs. 511 crores owed to it. It has also invoked arbitration proceedings against Ricoh but it was adjourned sine die after filing insolvency petition. The counsel on behalf of the Respondent contended  that the operational creditors of the company seek permission under the insolvency proceedings to continue the arbitration proceedings even though the COC of the company have already approved the CIRP. The Supreme Court held continuance of arbitration proceeding is permitted and dismissed the appeal, giving the parties the freedom to pursue all claims brought to them in the proceedings pending at the relevant time. It was stated that arbitration proceeding are continuing between the parties. If so, all disputes available to both parties will be settled on its own merits in accordance with the law in the proceedings in question.\n"

      "A writ petition filed by the respondent under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act and Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act was a writ petition filed by the respondent under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act.\n",

      "Section 86(1)(f) vests a statutory jurisdiction with the State Electricity Commission to adjudicate upon disputes between licensees and generating companies and to refer any dispute for arbitration. therefore, the appointment of arbitrators by the commission overrides the appointment of arbitrators by the High Court. This judgment was passed in the case of Chief General Manager (IPC) M P Power Trading Co. Ltd. &amp; Anr. vs. Narmada Equipments Pvt. Ltd. [C.A.No.1051/2021] by a Bench consisting of Hon’ble Justice Dr. Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, Hon’ble Justice M R Shah, and Hon’ble Justice Sanjiv Khanna. The present appeal arose from a judgment passed by the MP High Court where it appointed an Arbitrator in the dispute between the parties, in an application filed by the respondent under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996. The MP Electricity Board entered into a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) in 1999 with the respondent and the latter was to establish a mini hydroelectric project on a built and operate basis. However, the PPA was terminated in 2001 by the Board. The respondent initially filed a writ petition challenging the termination of the PPA, wherein the High Court, declined to entertain the petition in view of an arbitration agreement or clause in the PPA. the respondent filed a review petition which was also dismissed by the High Court. the respondent, therefore, issued a notice to the board seeking to resolve the dispute by mutual discussion. Since the respondent did not receive a reply to the notice in 2011, the respondent issued another notice to the Board. The respondent stated that if the Board did not act upon the notice within 30 days of its receipt, it would approach the High Court under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act. having received no reply, the respondent approached the High Court. The appointed arbitrators refused to initiate the proceeding since their fees had not been paid. The respondents filed an AC under which the Single Judge held that remedies under Section 86(1)(f) of the 2003 Electricity Act and under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act are independent of each other, and it was open to the High Court to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 11(6). Therefore the Appellant appealed before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court observed that section 86(1)(f) of the 2003 Act, is a special provision that overrides the general provisions contained in Section 11 of the 1996 Act. Section 86(1)(f) vests a statutory jurisdiction with the State Electricity Commission to adjudicate upon disputes between licensees and generating companies and to refer any dispute for arbitration. Further Section 174 of the Electricity Act, provides an overriding effect to the 1996 Act notwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than the 2003 Act itself. The Supreme Court further held that if there is an inherent lack of jurisdiction, the plea can be taken at any stage and also in collateral proceedings. The Court reiterated a well-established principle that a decree passed by a court without subject matter jurisdiction is a nullity, and that its invalidity could be set up whenever and wherever it is sought to be enforced or relied upon. Such a defect of jurisdiction cannot be cured even by the consent of the parties. Therefore the State Electricity Commission had jurisdiction to appoint the arbitrator since Section 86(1)(f) refers to disputes only between licensees and generating companies. Thus, the order of the High Court appointing an arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act is unsustainable. Accordingly, the appeal was allowed and the order of the High Court was set aside.\n"

LJ 1013 decided on 01.02.1989 and answered that after lodging the FIR no interference is permissible by this Court in exercise of its inherent powers hence no relief can be granted despite the issue is already resolved in the Learned counsel for the applicants has submitted that marriage of applicant No.1 was solemnized with the opposite party No.4 on 01.07.2009 and they were enjoying their matrimonial life and out of their wedlock two children were born namely Shourya and Tejal but due to some trivial issues FIR in question was lodged on 14.06.2019 by the opposite party No.4. In the present case investigation was started and mediation was also initiated before the court below but the applicant No.1 was not satisfied with the mediation proceeding initiated before the court below hence present applicationwas filed and with the consent of learned counsel for the applicant as well as learned counsel for the opposite party No.4 matter was sent to the Mediation and Conciliation Centre of this Court on 31.07.2020. The order dated 31.07.2020 reads as under: Vakalatnama filed by Shri Vinod Kumar Advocate on behalf of opposite party No.4 is taken on record. Heard learned counsel for the applicants as well as learned A.G.A. for the State and Shri Vinod Kumar learned counsel for opposite party No.4. The present 482 Cr.P.C. application has been filed to quash the entire proceedings arising out of F.I.R. dated 14.06.2019 lodged by the complainantagainst the applicants in Case Crime No. 5019 under Sections 323 354 498 A 504 of I.P.C. and 3 4 Dowry Prohibition Act 1961 Police Staton Madiaon District Lucknow and to refer this matter to the Mediation and Conciliation Center High Court. The instant dispute is the outcome of strained matrimonial relations between applicant No.1 and opposite party No.4. It has been submitted by learned counsel for the applicant that earlier the mediation process was started to amicably settle the dispute between applicant No.1 and opposite party No.4 however due to some wrong advice given by the Advocate of the applicants they could not take part in the mediation process and therefore one more opportunity be provided to the parties to settle their disputes amicably if possible through the process of mediation. Learned counsel for the opposite party No.4 is not having any objection to the request of learned counsel for the applicants. Having regard to the submissions advanced by learned counsel for the applicants and learned counsel for opposite party No.4 the matter is referred to the Mediation Center of this Bench on deposit of Rs. 15 000 which shall be deposited by the applicants within a week from today with the Senior Registrar of this Bench. When the Mediation Center will start functioning a communication will be sent by the Mediation Center of this Bench to the parties and on the first appearance of opposite party No.4 before the Mediation Centre Rs. 13 000 out of Rs. 15 000 which shall be deposited by the applicants shall be paid to her to meet out her expenses of travelling etc. Mediation Center will try its best to persuade the parties to arrive at a settlement and will submit a report to this Court within two months from the start of mediation. List this case in the Ist week of November 2020. Till then no coercive measure shall be taken against the applicants in the Learned counsel for the applicants has submitted that mediation was successfully concluded and opposite party No.4 join her matrimonial home with her husband and children on 07.07.2021 and settlement agreement was singed at the Mediation and Conciliation Centre of this Court by the applicant No.1and opposite party No.4along with their respective counsels of the parties and they also agreed to withdraw the proceeding of Case i.e.Case Crime No.5019and6 SCC 466. The relevant part of the judgment reads as under: 29.7. While deciding whether to exercise its power under Section 482 of the Code or not timings of settlement play a crucial role. Those cases where the settlement is arrived at immediately after the alleged commission of offence and the matter is still under investigation the High Court may be liberal in accepting the settlement to quash the criminal proceedings investigation. It is because of the reason that at this stage the investigation is still on and even the charge sheet has not been filed Likewise those cases where the charge is framed but the evidence is yet to start or the evidence is still at infancy stage the High Court can show benevolence in exercising its powers favourably but after prima facie assessment of the circumstances material mentioned above. On the other hand where the prosecution evidence is almost complete or after the conclusion of the evidence the matter is at the stage of argument normally the High Court should refrain from exercising its power under Section 482 of the Code as in such cases the trial court would be in a position to decide the case finally on merits and to come to a conclusion as to whether the offence under Section 307 IPC is committed or not Similarly in those cases where the conviction is already recorded by the trial court and the matter is at the appellate stage before the High Court mere compromise between the parties would not be a ground to accept the same resulting in acquittal of the offender who has already been convicted by the trial court. Here charge is proved under Section 307 IPC and conviction is already recorded of a heinous crime and therefore there is no question of sparing a convict found guilty of such a crime Jitendra Raghuvanshi And Others vs. Babita Raghuwanshi and another reported in 4 SCC 58. The relevant part of the judgment reads as under: 8. It is not in dispute that matrimonial disputes have been on considerable increase in recent times resulting in filing of complaints under Sections 498 A and 406 IPC not only against the husband but also against the relatives of the husband. The question is when such matters are resolved either by the wife agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial home or by mutual settlement of other pending disputes for which both the sides approached the High Court and jointly prayed for quashing of the criminal proceedings or the FIR or complaint by the wife under Sections 498 A and 406 IPC whether the prayer can be declined on the sole ground that since the offences are non compoundable under Section 320 of the Code it would be impermissible for the Court to quash the criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint 9. It is not in dispute that in the case on hand subsequent to the filing of the criminal complaint under Sections 498 A and 406 IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act 1961 with the help and intervention of family members friends and well wishers the parties concerned have amicably settled their differences and executed a compromise settlement Pursuant thereto the appellants filed the said compromise before the trial court with a request to place the same on record and to drop the criminal proceedings against the appellants herein. It is also not in dispute that in addition to the mutual settlement arrived at by the parties the respondent wife has also filed an affidavit stating that she did not wish to pursue the criminal proceedings against the appellants and fully supported the contents of the settlement deed. It is the grievance of the appellants that not only the trial court rejected such prayer of the parties but also the High Court failed to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code only on the ground that the criminal proceedings relate to the offences punishable under Sections 498 A and 406 IPC which are non compoundable in nature 12. After considering the law laid down in State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal 1992 Supp SCC 335 : 1992 SCC 426] and explaining the decisions rendered in Madhu Limaye v. State of Maharashtra4 SCC 551 : 1978 SCC 10] Surendra Nath Mohanty v. State of Orissa5 SCC 238 : 1999 SCC998] and Pepsi Foods Ltd. v Judicial Magistrate5 SCC 749 : 1998 SCC1400] this Court held:4 SCC 675 : 2003 SCC848] SCC p 680 para 8 “8. … We are therefore of the view that if for the purpose of securing the ends of justice quashing of FIR becomes necessary Section 320 would not be a bar to the exercise of power of quashing. It is however a different matter depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case whether to exercise or not such a power.” Considering matrimonial matters this Court also held:4 SCC 675 : 2003 SCC848] SCC p. 682 para “12. The special features in such matrimonial matters are evident It becomes the duty of the court to encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes.” 17. In the light of the above discussion we hold that the High Court in exercise of its inherent powers can quash the criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in appropriate cases in order to meet the ends of justice and Section 320 of the Code does not limit or affect the powers of the High Court under Section 482 of the Code Parbatbhai Aahir and Others vs. State of Gujrat and Another reported in9 SCC 641. The relevant part of the judgment reads as under : 16. The broad principles which emerge from the precedents on the subject may be summarised in the following propositions 16.1. Section 482 preserves the inherent powers of the High Court to prevent an abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. The provision does not confer new powers. It only recognises and preserves powers which inhere in the High Court 16.2. The invocation of the jurisdiction of the High Court to quash a first information report or a criminal proceeding on the ground that a settlement has been arrived at between the offender and the victim is not the same as the invocation of jurisdiction for the purpose of compounding an offence. While compounding an offence the power of the court is governed by the provisions of Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973. The power to quash under Section 482 is attracted even if the offence is non compoundable 16.3. In forming an opinion whether a criminal proceeding or complaint should be quashed in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482 the High Court must evaluate whether the ends of justice would justify the exercise of the inherent power 16.4. While the inherent power of the High Court has a wide ambit and plenitude it has to be exercisedto secure the ends of justice orto prevent an abuse of the process of any court 16.5. The decision as to whether a complaint or first information report should be quashed on the ground that the offender and victim have settled the dispute revolves ultimately on the facts and circumstances of each case and no exhaustive elaboration of principles can be formulated 16.6. In the exercise of the power under Section 482 and while dealing with a plea that the dispute has been settled the High Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the offence. Heinous and serious offences involving mental depravity or offences such as murder rape and dacoity cannot appropriately be quashed though the victim or the family of the victim have settled the dispute. Such offences are truly speaking not private in nature but have a serious impact upon society. The decision to continue with the trial in such cases is founded on the overriding element of public interest in punishing persons for serious offences 16.7. As distinguished from serious offences there may be criminal cases which have an overwhelming or predominant element of a civil dispute They stand on a distinct footing insofar as the exercise of the inherent power to quash is concerned 16.8. Criminal cases involving offences which arise from commercial financial mercantile partnership or similar transactions with an essentially civil flavour may in appropriate situations fall for quashing where parties have settled the dispute 16.9. In such a case the High Court may quash the criminal proceeding if in view of the compromise between the disputants the possibility of a conviction is remote and the continuation of a criminal proceeding would cause oppression and prejudice and 16.10. There is yet an exception to the principle set out in propositions 16.8. and 16.9. above. Economic offences involving the financial and economic well being of the State have implications which lie beyond the domain of a mere dispute between private disputants. The High Court would be justified in declining to quash where the offender is involved in an activity akin to a financial or economic fraud or misdemeanour. The consequences of the act complained of upon the financial or economic system will weigh in the balance B.S. Joshi And Others vs. State of Haryana And Another reported in 2003) 4 SCC 675. The relevant part of the judgment reads as under : 8. It is thus clear that Madhu Limaye case4 SCC 551 : 1978 SCC10] does not lay down any general proposition limiting power of quashing the criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint as vested in Section 482 of the Code or extraordinary power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. We are therefore of the view that if for the purpose of securing the ends of justice quashing of FIR becomes necessary Section 320 would not be a bar to the exercise of power of quashing. It is however a different matter depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case whether to exercise or not such a power. Considering matrimonial matters this Court also held 12. The special features in such matrimonial matters are evident. It becomes the duty of the court to encourage genuine settlements of 15. In view of the above discussion we hold that the High Court in exercise of its inherent powers can quash criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint and Section 320 of the Code does not limit or affect the powers under Section 482 of the Code Gian Singh vs. State of Punjab and Another reported in 10 SCC 303. The relevant part of the judgment reads as under: 61. the power of the High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under Section 320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz. :to secure the ends of justice orto prevent abuse of the process of any court. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or FIR may be exercised where the offender and the victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed. However before exercise of such power the High Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences like murder rape dacoity etc. cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim s family and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and have a serious impact on society. Similarly any compromise between the victim and the offender in relation to the offences under special statutes like the Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants while working in that capacity etc. cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour stand on a different footing for the purposes of quashing particularly the offences arising from commercial financial mercantile civil partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases the High Court may quash the criminal proceedings if in its view because of the compromise between the offender and the victim the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of the criminal case would put the accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and compromise between the victim and the wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice it is appropriate that the criminal case is put to an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in the affirmative the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding Learned counsel for the applicants has also relied on the recent judgment of Hon ble Supreme Court in the case of Ramawatar vs State of Madhya Pradesh reported in 2021 SCC Online SC 966. The relevant part of the judgment reads as under: 19. Having considered the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case in light of the afore stated principles as well as having meditated on the application for compromise we are inclined to invoke the powers under Article 142 and quash the instant Criminal proceedings with the sole objective of doing complete justice between the parties before us. We say so for the reasons that Firstly the very purpose behind Section 3(1)(x) of the SC ST is to deter caste based insults and intimidations when they are used with the intention of demeaning a victim on account of he she belonging to the Scheduled Caste Scheduled Tribe community. In the present case the record manifests that there was an undeniable pre existing civil dispute between the parties. The case of the Appellant from the very beginning has been that the alleged abuses were uttered solely on account of frustration and anger over the pending dispute. Thus the genesis of the deprecated incident was the afore stated civil property dispute Considering this aspect we are of the opinion that it would not be incorrect to categorise the occurrence as one being overarchingly private in nature having only subtle undertones of criminality even though the provisions of a special statute have been attracted in the present case Secondly the offence in question for which the Appellant has been convicted does not appear to exhibit his mental depravity. The aim of the SC ST Act is to protect members of the downtrodden classes from atrocious acts of the upper strata of the society. It appears to us that although the Appellant may not belong to the same caste as the Complainant he too belongs to the relatively weaker backward section of the society and is certainly not in any better economic or social position when compared to the victim. Despite the rampant prevalence of segregation in Indian villages whereby members of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe community are forced to restrict their quartes only to certain areas it is seen that in the present case the Appellant and the Complainant lived in adjoining houses. Therefore keeping in mind the socio economic status of the Appellant we are of the opinion that the overriding objective of the SC ST Act would not be overwhelmed if the present proceedings are quashed Thirdly the incident occurred way back in the year 1994. Nothing on record indicates that either before or after the purported compromise any untoward incident had transpired between the parties. The State Counsel has also not brought to our attention any other occurrence that would lead us to believe that the Appellant is either a repeat offender or is unremorseful about what transpired Fourthly the Complainant has on her own free will without any compulsion entered into a compromise and wishes to drop the present criminal proceedings against the accused Fifthly given the nature of the offence it is immaterial that the trial against the Appellant had been concluded Sixthly the Appellant and the Complainant parties are residents of the same village and live in very close proximity to each other. We have no reason to doubt that the parties themselves have voluntarily settled their differences. Therefore in order to avoid the revival of healed wounds and to advance peace and harmony it will be prudent to effectuate the present Learned counsel for the applicants has submitted that in the law laid down by the Full Bench of this Court in the case of Ram Lal Yadav relied by learned A.G.A. is wrongly interpreted as in the aforesaid judgment it is held that after lodging the FIR which discloses the commission of a cognizable offence statutory powers of Police under Section 156 Cr.P.C. to investigate the case registered on the basis of information no interference is permissible in the investigation in the exercise of its inherent powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. and this Court has no jurisdiction to direct a police officer not to arrest the accused during the pendency of investigation of the case but High Court can always issue a writ of mandamus under Article 226 of the Constitution restraining the police officer for misusing his legal power in relation to arrest. 10. Learned counsel for the applicants has submitted that provisions of anticipatory bail under Section 438 Cr.P.C. was omitted in the State of U.P. vide U.P. Act No.176 w.e.f. 28.11.1975 the protection of pre arrest was not available therefore application u s 482 Cr.P.C.) was being filed restraining the police from arrest during investigation and in the case of Ram Lal Yadav this controversy was decided that under Section 482 Cr.P.C. Police Officer cannot be restrained from arresting the accused persons during the course of investigation but by way of writ of mandamus this power can be used. This question is already settled in the case of State of Haryana and Others vs. Bhajan Lal and Others reported in 1992) Supp 1 SCC 335 that First Information Report can be quashed either under Section 482 Cr.P.C. or under Article 226 of the Constitution. The relevant part of the judgment reads as under: 102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant provisions of the Code under Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this Court in a series of decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power under Article 226 or the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code which we have extracted and reproduced above we give the following categories of cases by way of illustration wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice though it may not be possible to lay down any precise clearly defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should be 1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused.(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials if any accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence justifying an investigation by police officers under Section 156(1 of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code 3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against the accused 4) Where the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a non cognizable offence no investigation is permitted by a police officer without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code 5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused 6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the concerned Act to the institution and continuance of the proceedings and or where there is a specific provision in the Code or the concerned Act providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party 7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge Learned counsel for the applicants has submitted that in the case of Ramawatarthe Hon ble Supreme Court has held that even at the stage of appeal against the conviction order power of inherent jurisdiction can be invoked to do the complete justice therefore in the present case First Information Report and its consequential proceedings may be quashed in terms of settlement agreement executed before the Mediation and Conciliation Centre of this Court. Learned A.G.A. as well as learned counsel for the opposite party No.4 fairly conceded this fact that matter was sent to the Mediation and Conciliation Centre of this Court on 31.07.2020 and it was successfully concluded and presently opposite party No.4 is residing with her husbandand children 13. Considering the arguments of learned counsel for the applicants learned counsel for the opposite party No.4 as well as learned A.G.A. and going through the record it is evident that FIR was lodged by the opposite party No.4due to some trivial issues and during the course of investigation First Information Report and its consequential proceedings were challenged before this Court and thereafter matter was referred to the Mediation and Conciliation Centre of this Court with the consent of counsel for the opposite party No.4 on the first date and it was successfully concluded and settlement agreement was executed between the parties and opposite party No.4 join her matrimonial home on 07.03.2021 and enjoying her life with her husbandand children. 14. As in the case of Ram Lal Yadavthere is no bar from interference in the FIR in applicationas this question was already decided in the case of Bhajan Lal that inherent powers can be invoked in seven conditions which reads as under: Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused 2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials if any accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence justifying an investigation by police officers under Section 156(1 of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code 3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against the accused 4) Where the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a non cognizable offence no investigation is permitted by a police officer without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code 5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused 6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the concerned Actto the institution and continuance of the proceedings and or where there is a specific provision in the Code or the concerned Act providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party 7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge 15. As in Criminal Procedure Code 1898 there was no such provision in relating to inherent jurisdiction of High Court but the legislature added Section 561 A by inserting in 1923 Act No.XVII of 1923. Section 561 A of the Criminal Procedure Code 1898 which reads as under: Saving of inherent power of High Court Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent power of the High Court to make such orders as ma be necessary to give effect to any order under this Code or to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice The Law Commission in its 40th report observed that the statutory power under Section 561 A Cr.P.C. is extended only the inherent power of High Court. One may compare it with the recognition of the inherent powers of all civil courts by Section 151 Cr.P.C. Later on Law Commission in its 41st reports recommended that inherent power of Section 561 A Cr.P.C. be extended to all Criminal Courts to prevent abuse of process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice but the legislature did not accept the recommendation of commission to extend the inherent power as mentioned in Section 561 A of Criminal Procedure Code 1898. Para 46.2st report of Law Commission is reproduced as under: Section 561 A recognises the inherent powers of the Section 561 A High Court to do real and substantial justice between parties. Assuming its existence the Section provides that nothing in the Code shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent power of the High Court to give effect to any order under the Codeor otherwise to secure the ends of justice. Fourteenth Report. Vol. II page 829 the Law Commission observed: This statutory recognition however extends only to the inherent powers of the High Court. One may compare it with the recognition of the inherent powers of all civil courts by Section 151 Criminal Procedure In a number of decisions before and after the enactment of Section 561A various High Courts have also recognised the existence of such power in subordinate Courts. We would therefore recommend a statutory recognition of such inherent power which has been recognized as vesting in all subordinate criminal courts. However the general principle of law is that the inherent power of a court can be exercised only to give effect to orders made by it or to prevent abuse of its own processes We agree with this recommendation. We do not however consider it necessary or desirable to go further and recognise and inherent power in Courts of Session and other Courts of Appeal to pass appropriate orders to prevent the abuse of the process of any We propose that the Section may be expanded as follows: 561 A. Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or saving of inherent powers of Criminal Courts affect the inherent power a) of the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under this Code or to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice or b) of any Criminal Court to make such orders as may be necessary to prevent abuse of its process or otherwise to secure the ends of justice In the case of Ram Lal Yadav the provision of anticipatory bail under Section 438 Cr.P.C. was not existing therefore there was a delima to get the remedy of pre arrest during investigation then it was clarified by this Court that High Court has no inherent powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to interfere with the arrest of accused persons during the course of investigation but it was clarified that High Court can always issue a writ of mandamus under Article 226 of the Constitution restraining the police officer for misusing his legal power in relation to arrest and FIR can be quashed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. which is covered under the principle laid down by Hon ble Supreme Court in the Case of Bhajan Lal this Court held that Investigating Officer can not be restrained from arresting the accused of a cognizable offence. The Hon ble Supreme Court in the case of Bhajan Lal and Ramawatar already held that FIR and its consequential proceedings can be quashedtherefore this Court is of the view that impugned FIR and its consequential proceedings is liable to be quashed in terms of settlement agreement of parties before Mediation and Conciliation Centre of this Court. 19. For the discussions made above the present application is allowed and First Information Report No.5019 under Sections 323 354 498A 504 I.P.C. and Section 3 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act 1961 Police Station Mandion District Lucknow is 20.

      "IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI NAMAN SHARMA Reserved on: February 24 2022 Decided on: March 04 2022 BAIL APPLN. 3673 2021 ….. Petitioner Represented by: Mr. Anurag Bindal Mr. Ankur Gupta and Mr. B. Khan Advocates. STATE THROUGH NARCOTICS CONTROL ..... Respondent Represented by: Mr. Rajesh Manchanda Special P.P. for the NCB. HON BLE MS. JUSTICE MUKTA GUPTA MUKTA GUPTA J. By this petition the petitioner seeks regular bail in case No. VIII 46 DZU 2021 under Sections 8(c) 20 22 29 of the NDPS Act on a complaint filed by the respondent NCB. Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that even as per the statement recorded under Section 67 of the NDPS Act which is inadmissible in evidence the best case of the respondent is that the petitioner used to consume Ganja in the year 2017 and the payments thereof were made in the year 2021. Even as per the investigation the group was created by Mohd. Aslam and Parichay Arora and merely because the petitioner was also made an Admin of the group the liability of the entire group cannot be fastened on BAIL APPLN. 3673 2021 the petitioner. Even from the transactions of payments made to Mohd. Aslam and Neil Singhvi by the petitioner at best four or five transactions have been shown wherein amounts transferred are ₹11 000 ₹5700 ₹1000 ₹2000 etc. The petitioner is not a drug trafficker. Though not admitting even if at some stage the petitioner consumed the drugs the same would not amount to dealing in a drug trafficking racket. He further states that the similarly placed co accused namely Devesh Vasa has been granted bail by this Court and Aashray Pandey has been granted bail by the learned Special Court and hence on parity the petitioner be also granted bail. The petitioner was working after completing his studies at Kolkata when he was picked up by the officers of the respondent and implicated in this case. The complaint has been filed and the petitioner is no more required for investigation. Learned counsel for the respondent states that in view of the embargo under Section 37 of the NDPS Act no case for grant of bail to the petitioner is made out as there is every possibility that on being released on bail the petitioner will again indulge in same kind of activities and the petitioner being a part of the larger drug network his role cannot be segregated from the other accused. Case of the prosecution in nutshell is that on the basis of an information Guhan Sarvothaman was intercepted at the IGI Airport on 4th August 2021. On his search 30 gms. of ganja and 0.45 gms. of Ecstasy were recovered. In the interrogation he revealed about his friend Rahul Mishra his address and the possibility of recovery of contraband from his house. Search was made at the house of Guhan Sarvothaman at Greater Noida resulting in recovery of 1 kg of ganja and ₹15.5 lakhs in cash. Search was also made at the house of Rahul Mishra at Faridabad from where 1.05 kg of ganja was recovered. Guhan Sarvothaman further BAIL APPLN. 3673 2021 disclosed about one accused Aashray Pandey who was intercepted at Ambience Mall with a parcel containing 410 gms. of ganja. Guhan Sarvothaman also informed about one Tareena Bhatnagar who had promised to get him high quality ganja and for which she had paid a sum of ₹6 lakhs to Jasbir Singh. Thus the links of Jasbir Singh were sought to be traced and it was found that Jasbir Singh operated under the pseudo name Optims Prime and Sharadha Surana operated under the pseudo name Beanskey on Telegram App in Orient Express Group. The Orient Express Group wherein number of people were indulging in sale and purchase of narcotics was created by Parichay Arora and Mohd. Aslam and the petitioner was one of the Admins of the said social media group. On the disclosure of Jasbir Singh and Sharadha Surana search was conducted at the house of Suvashish Roy at Greater Noida from where 1.250 kgs. of Ganja 16 gms. Ecstasy pills 6 gms. Heroine 40 gms. of Charas and 130 gms. of suspected psychotropic substance in different coloured little pills were found and 39.700 gms. concentrate of cannabis and 2.530 gms. liquid cannabis from a parcel at Foreign Post Office Kolkata. One more accused Raghunath Kumar was identified who was recognized as Shopper stop on Wicket App who used to arrange narcotics drugs. According to the investigation the contraband was marketed on social media platforms and then delivered to the customers consumers through parcels. Admittedly even as per the prosecution no recovery of contraband was made from the petitioner and the only evidence against him is that he was one of the Admins of Orient express group which was created by Mohd. Aslam and Parichay Arora and that the petitioner had transferred certain sums of money. As per the statement of accounts placed on record a sum of ₹11 000 was transferred by the petitioner to Mohd. Aslam on 21st June BAIL APPLN. 3673 2021 2020 ₹5700 to Neil Singhvi on 9th October 2020. Further two transactions of ₹1000 each and a transaction of ₹2300 have been made to Parichay Arora. Even in the statement of the petitioner recorded under Section 67 of the NDPS Act which is not admissible in evidence in view of the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court reported as 4 SCC 1 Tofan Singh Vs. State of Tamil Nadu it is stated that in August 2020 during the lockdown the petitioner was looking to buy weed for his consumption through telegram thus used the keywords like ‘weeds marijuana’ when he entered into two groups where he got scammed of ₹3500 . In the same group there was a user named Chico who asked the petitioner to join another group where there was a seller with the user name Pptheplugwho sent him some weed for the first time in advance without paying him which made him believe that he was a real seller. Later Aslam and Parichay Arora started adding more people in the group and made it a group of 200 members. In the group there were 5 7 sellers who used to send weed parcels via courier services and the petitioner was one of them who used to buy for his consumption. From the facts of the complaint as noted above and even based on the statement under Section 67 of the NDPS Act and the money transactions it is evident that the petitioner was at best consuming narcotics drugs which he used to buy from the sellers in the group. Complaint has already been filed by the respondent the petitioner is in judicial custody since 4th September 2021 and is no more required for investigation. Consequently this Court deems it fit to grant bail to the petitioner. It is therefore directed that the petitioner be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond in the sum of ₹1 lakh with two surety bonds of the like amount each subject to the satisfaction of the learned Trial BAIL APPLN. 3673 2021 Court CMM Duty Magistrate out of which one surety would be a family member of the petitioner further subject to the conditions that the petitioner will not leave the country without the prior permission of the Court concerned and in case of change of residential address and or mobile number the same will be intimated to the Court concerned by way of an affidavit. Further the petitioner will appear before the NCB office at Kolkata on the first Monday of every calendar month at 6.00 P.M. Petition is disposed of. Order be uploaded on the website of this Court.

Briefly stated Plaintiff is a Federation of severalCo op. housing societies in Nirmal Nagar Area BandraMumbai. Suit bearing L.C.

No. 418 being Exhibit \"E\" hereto.\"5. Mr. Walawalkar learned Senior Advocateappearing for the Appellant Defendant No. 1 Corporationhas assailed the impugned order dated 09.03.2021 andcontended that the Corporation was redeveloping andreconstructing an already existing dilapidated toilet blockstanding on an open portion space in C.T.S. No. 418.This is the factual position and the Plaintiff has suppressedthe same while approaching the trial court. He submittedthat the original toilet block having 40 toilet seats was in avery bad condition and practically unusable pursuant towhich several complaints were received from the localMunicipal Councillor of Beat 95 and a local organization on 18 05 2021 on 22 03 civil ao st 9596 21 & ia st 9597 21.doccalled Prabhati Nirmal Sudhar Samitee. Thereafter theofficers of the Corporation jointly visited and inspected theoriginal toilet block structure along with the local Councillorand local residents from Nirmalnagar and Deepakwadi theoriginal toilet block was constructed in the year 2010 11from the MLA fund of then MLA Mr. PrakashSawant the WC pans were in broken condition bottoms of the doorswere corrugated and damaged completely vent pipes weredamaged at many places and the overall condition was filthyand bad. The photographs of the original toilet block whichare part of the paper book were also referred to andattention of the Court was drawn thereto. The same has notbeen denied by the learned counsel for the Plaintiff which ismaterial.5.1. Mr. Walawalkar submitted that considering thepopulation of the locality in Deepakwadi and Nirmalnagar asurvey was carried out by appointing CBO called PrathaSamajik Sanstha which reported that 57 toilet seats were therequirement considering that there were 788 ladies and 873gents residing in the said area. Accordingly estimation planning designing and construction of the RCC communitytoilet block was planned and executed to have 67 toiletseats. The Competent Authority for administrative sanction on 18 05 2021 on 22 03 civil ao st 9596 21 & ia st 9597 21.docapproved the proposal submitted by the Assistant Engineer(Maintenance department) H East ward on 19.03.2020 workorder was issued to Defendant No. 3 on 14.07.2020 andimmediately thereafter during the last monsoon the oldtoilet block was demolished and reconstruction workcommenced. Though Defendant No.2 MHADA had inquiredwith Defendant No. 1 Corporation about the permission itwas put to the notice of MHADA that the Secretary of UrbanDevelopment Department had directed that no NOC wouldbe required from the land holding authorities. NeverthelessMr. Walawalkar submitted that the Corporation shallapproach MHADA if so required and complete the formalitiesas both the Corporation and MHADA being instrumentalitiesof the State are planning authorities and carry out similarfunctions. 5.2. He submitted that the toilet block reconstructionis being done under the Central Government s SwachhaBharat Abhiyaan Scheme. He submitted that construction oflatrines did not require permission of the local bodies in asmuch as the land holding authorities did not have theauthority to disallow construction of latrinesunder the SwachhaBharat Missionfor censused structures noted in on 18 05 2021 on 22 03 civil ao st 9596 21 & ia st 9597 21.doc2011 census. In any event it was submitted thatreconstruction of the toilet block was in place of the oldtoilet block and not a new construction it was in the largerpublic interest and would serve the population of the slumareas of Deepakwadi and Nirmalnagar who were using theearlier toilet block and who would now be benefited by thenew toilet block structure it was in the interest of residentsof the locality and in absence of a clear right title andinterest the Plaintiff Federation could not oppose the same.5.3. While referring to the impugned order Mr.Walawalkar submitted that the finding given in paragraphNo. 14 is prima facie on the face of record incorrect. Hesubmitted that it has been held in the impugned order thatDefendant No. 1 cannot enter on private land by any privateperson even though the work of construction of public toiletis in the larger public interest. He submitted that this findingand terming Defendant No. 1 as an encroacher on theprivate land owned by Defendant No. 2 MHADA forunauthorized construction of public toilet is incorrect in factand law. He submitted that the impugned order is passedon the basis that the Corporation is constructing a freshstructure toilet block without looking into the record thatthere existed an earlier toilet block of 40 seats. This aspect on 18 05 2021 on 22 03 civil ao st 9596 21 & ia st 9597 21.docis missing in the entire impugned order. The impugned orderproceeds on the basis that the Plaintiff is the owner of C.T.S.No. 418 and this is incorrect and erroneous in as much asthe Plaintiff does not have any conveyance in its favour.Merely on the basis of a lay out it cannot be assumed thatthe Plaintiff becomes the owner of C.T.S. No. 418 and morespecifically of the open space where other constructionshave been in place since long. He submitted that theargument of the Plaintiff that there are two other toiletblocks within 30 meters of the said site cannot becountenanced as proper estimation planning and executionof the present toilet block has been done based upon thepopulation of the area on the basis of the 2011 census. Hetherefore persuaded the Court to set aside and quash theimpugned order and allow the Appeal from Order filed by theCorporation in the larger public interest.6. PER CONTRA It is the case of the Plaintiff thatDefendant No. 1 Corporation suddenly started carrying outwork of construction of a public toilet block on an openportion of land in C.T.S No. 418. The case pitched by thelearned counsel appearing for the Plaintiff is that DefendantNo.1 Corporation suddenly out of blue started constructionwork of a public toilet structure on a portion of open plot of on 18 05 2021 on 22 03 civil ao st 9596 21 & ia st 9597 21.docland in C.T.S. No. 418. Plaintiff has asserted that the openspace where the toilet is being constructed is being used bythe members of the Plaintiff s Federation of Socieities for thepast several years Plaintiff is in settled possession of thesaid open space and is the owner of the said open space ofland Defendant No.1 Corporation has no right or permissionfrom Defendant No. 2 MHADA to construct or startconstructing on the said open space of land. This case isstated in paragraph Nos. 14 and 15 of the plaint.6.1. At the outset Mr. Kadam on a query put by theCourt has very candidly admitted that the case stated inparagraph No. 15 is incorrect in as much as there wasalready an old dilapidated toilet structure standing on thesaid open portion space in C.T.S. No. 418 for several yearsand since it was in a precarious condition the Corporationdemolished the same and started construction of a newtoilet block with 67 seats for the benefit of the slumdwellers users. On the issue of title Mr. Kadam is not in aposition to show any document or evidence of title to thesaid open portion space where the public toilet blockstructure is being reconstructed and redeveloped by theCorporation save and except agitating that the entire C.T.S.No. 418 comprises of several buildings who are members of on 18 05 2021 on 22 03 civil ao st 9596 21 & ia st 9597 21.docthe Plaintiff Federation and the said buildings haveapproached MHADA for the purpose of redevelopment andMHADA has granted permission to the Plaintiff forredevelopment of the said lay out subject to conditions.Thus it is the case of the Plaintiff that by virtue of the layout being sanctioned by MHADA and the offer letter beinggiven to the Plaintiff Plaintiff has become the owner of landi.e C.T.S. No. 418 which includes the open portion spacewhere Defendant No. 1 Corporation is constructing thetoilet block. Therefore it is imperative on the part ofDefendant No. 1 Corporation to obtain permission andsanction from Defendant No. 2 MHADA as well as seekpermission of the Plaintiff Federation. Apart from the abovesubmission admittedly there is no documentary evidence ofany registered conveyance of C.T.S. No. 418 in favour of thePlaintiff Federation. 6.2. Mr. Kadam submitted that most of the societies inthe lay out are owners of their respective structures as thesame has been conveyed to them by Defendant No. 2MHADA. In view thereof several societies have becomeowners of the open land appurtenant to their respectivestructures and the land beneath their respective structures.Hence the Plaintiff has become owner of C.T.S. No. 418 in on 18 05 2021 on 22 03 civil ao st 9596 21 & ia st 9597 21.docits entirety. Mr. Kadam finally submitted that if the toiletblock is constructed on the said open portion space it willgive a reduced return of FSI to the various flat occupiers andmembers of the societies after redevelopment. Therefore he supported the impugned order and stated that it wascorrectly passed and the same needs to be upheld bydismissing the Appeal from Order and the Interim Applicationfiled by the Corporation.7. Submissions of the parties have been on pleadedlines. Perused the material on record and pleadings. 8. In its pleadings Plaintiff has not produced anydocumentary evidence of its title to C.T.S. No. 418.Therefore to accept the case of the Plaintiff that theFederation is the owner of C.T.S. No. 418 is difficult.Although the Plaintiff has produced an offer letter andsanctioned lay out of C.T.S. No. 418 the same does notcertify that the Plaintiff is the owner of C.T.S. No. 418.Certainly the members of the societies of the PlaintiffFederation are the owners of their respective buildings andthe land beneath the buildings and the area appurtenantthereto but to claim ownership of the open space portion1 on 18 05 2021 on 22 03 civil ao st 9596 21 & ia st 9597 21.docwhere the original toilet block existed or any other structurestanding on C.T.S. No. 418 without any documentaryevidence of tile of transfer and conveyance from DefendantNo. 2 MHADA cannot be accepted by the Court. Thus it isproved that the Plaintiff lacks title in respect of C.T.S. No.418. 8.1. That apart the critical fact which determines thecase of the parties is the fact that construction of the presentpublic toilet block is not a fresh construction. Admittedly theold toilet block of 40 seats was already present at the site onthe open portion space in C.T.S. No. 418. It wasdilapidated unusable and therefore under the SwachhaBharat Abhiyaan Scheme after following the due process oflaw reconstruction and redevelopment of the old toilet blockis contemplated executed and implemented. Thus thecase of the Plaintiff therefore cannot be countenanced thatthe Corporation is an encroacher of C .T.S. No. 418 andstarted construction of toilet block suddenly withoutpermission from MHADA or without permission from thePlaintiff. 8.2. The construction of the toilet block is a sociallybeneficial project for the residents of Deepakwadi and1 on 18 05 2021 on 22 03 civil ao st 9596 21 & ia st 9597 21.docNirmalnagar under the Swachha Bharat Abhiyaan Scheme. Itis surprising that despite the old toilet block being in placetill the last monsoon the averments of the Plaintiff that theopen space has been in existence since development and layout and also used by all the societies forming part andparcel of the said lay out is on the face of record false. It isan admitted position that C.T.S. No. 418 is surrounded byhutments and the old toilet block provided succour to thesehutments. Since it was in an unusable state of affairs thesame is now being remodelled reconstructed andredeveloped for the benefit of the existing slum dwellers whowere originally using the old toilet block. The affidavit dated19.01.201 filed by the Junior Engineerof theCorporation on behalf of Defendant No.1 Corporation exhibitsthe aforesaid facts. For the purpose of reference paragraphNo. 7 of the said affidavit which is relevant is extracted asunder: \"7.

NO. 418 as a1 on 18 05 2021 on 22 03 civil ao st 9596 21 & ia st 9597 21.docrank encroacher to construct the toilet block and there is ahistory to the construction of the new toilet block whichcannot be lost sight of. Under the Brihanmumbai MahanagarPalika Swachha Bharat Abhiyaan Scheme it is contemplatedthat toilet block should be constructed in various slums ofMumbai through the concerned ward office and accordingly after following the due process of law the same has beendone. The total number of residents who would be using theredeveloped public toilet block to be constructed by theCorporation would be as follows: \"Total House : 420Total Adults: 1461Female 696Male 765Total of above 10 yrs.Boys 33Girls 40Total of below 10 yrs.Boys 75Girls 52Total Public : 1661\"8.4. A budget of Rs. 2 09 61 500 has been sanctionedfor this work and technically verified by the ExecutiveEngineer H East Ward and the work order has been given.Apart from the aforesaid issues it is important to understandthe need and necessity of the hour. What is significant tonote is the fact that the new toilet block will be coming up onthe same place where the old existing toilet block wasstanding. The Plaintiff had never objected to the old existing1 on 18 05 2021 on 22 03 civil ao st 9596 21 & ia st 9597 21.doctoilet block which was constructed in the year 2010 11 anddetails of the same is placed on record and it is only now thatthe Plaintiff has sought to object on the ground of title andentitlement to C.T.S. No. 418. Not a single documentevidencing title or entitlement of the Plaintiff has beenplaced before the Court to support the impugned orderthough it has been admitted that Defendant No. 2 MHADA isthe owner of C.T.S.

The State of Maharashtraunder the Swachha Bharat Missionhas maintainedthat the scheme is implemented with the objective ofensuring open defecation free cities and scientific collectionand processing of solid waste. The guidelines of SwachhaBharat MissionScheme of the Governmentenvisages that beneficiary households will be targetedirrespective of whether they lived in authorized unauthorized colonies of notified non notified slums underSBMscheme. When the Plaintiff does not have titleto C.T.S.

Therefore the Plaintiff cannot claimentitlement to the land beneath the original toilet block orthe area of the original toilet block or the structure of theoriginal toilet block. The case of the Plaintiff therefore fails. 9. In view of the above discussion and findings theimpugned order dated 09.03.2021 needs to be interferedwith and is quashed and set aside.

      "IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI Reserved on: 04.03.2021 Pronounced on: 16.03.2021 BAIL APPLN. 2585 2020 & Crl.M.(B) 8044 2020 MOHIT AGGARWAL Through: Mr. Ramesh Gupta Senior Advocate Petitioner with Mr.S.P.Singh Rathore & Mr. Shailendera Singh Advocates NARCOTICS CONTROL BUREAU ..... Respondent Through: Mr. Rajesh Manchanda Standing Counsel for NCB with Mr. Rajat Manchanda HON BLE MR. JUSTICE SURESH KUMAR KAIT In case SC No. SC 1334 2020 titled as NCB Vs. Gaurav Aggarwal & Ors petitioner is facing trial for the offences under Sections 8 22 & 29 of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act 1985. Petitioner was arrested by the officials of Narcotic Control Bureauon 11.01.2020 and is in judicial custody since 11.01.2020. Vide present petition petitioner is seeking bail while claiming to be innocent and of having been falsely implicated in the present case. The present petition has been filed on the ground that petitioner is a BAIL APPLN. 2585 2020 law abiding citizen and is running business in the name of Madhav Pharma for sale purchase and transport of various medicines while holding valid drug license under Form 20B & 21B of Drugs & Cosmetics Act 1945. Petitioner has pleaded that he has maintained all records complying with all the terms and conditions of the license. Petitioner has further pleaded that no contraband was recovered from his possession and he has been falsely implicated in this case. The crux of the prosecution case as per complaint dated 09.01.2020 is that upon receipt of secret information by Chetan Sharma Intelligence Officerthat one parcel bearing Airway Bill No. D90471207 booked by one Gaurav Kumar from Agra for delivery to one Manoj Kumar at Ludhiana Punjab is lying at DTDC Khasra No. 16 06 Smalakha Kapasehra New Delhi is suspected of containing NRX tablets and if captured huge quantity of narcotic tablets can be recovered. This information was reduced into writing and was placed before Amit Kumar Tiwary Superintendent who directed Manoj Kumar Junior Intelligence Officer to constitute a team and take further action as per law. Thereafter Manoj Kumar Junior Intelligence Officer along with other members of the constituted raiding team namely Raj Kumar Maurya Intelligence Officer BAIL APPLN. 2585 2020 Ajay Kumar Speoy and N.P. Singh Driver collected the DD kit weighing machine I.O. kit and other related seizing material and seal of Narcotic Control Bureau DZU 2. The team left the Delhi office and reached at above mentioned address and met Durgesh Prasad Vigilance Senior Executive of DTDC. After introducing themselves by showing their identify cards informed about their purpose of coming and requested him and his colleague one Aas Mohd. Khan to become independent witnesses for the search and seizure proceedings to which they accepted. Manoj Kumar Junior Intelligence Officer offered these independent witnesses to search him and his team members to which they declined. Thereafter the suspected article was opened in the presence of these two independent witnesses. On opening the said parcel it was found to be jute bag on which and on the bill the name of the consignor was written as Gaurav Kumar Agra and consignee was written as Manoj Kumar Campa Cola Chowk Ludhiana 141003. 4. When the said jute bag was opened a brown card box was found which contained 50 000 tablets of Tramadol weighing 20 kg. Since these were being sent as mis declared item without bill and were in contravention of the NDPS Act therefore seizure proceedings were initiated after due BAIL APPLN. 2585 2020 procedure. A notice under Section 67 of NDPS was issued to independent witnesses Durgesh Prasad and Aas Mohd. Khan. Thereafter Manoj Kumar Intelligence Officer collected relevant information about Gaurav Kumar of Agra and Manoj Kumar of Ludhiana from DTDC office and as mentioned on Airway Bill and prepared disclosure to this effect. The disclosure statement of Manoj Kumar Yadav Intelligence Officer was placed before Amit Kumar Tiwary Superintendent who directed Sh. Sachin Kumar Intelligence Officer to take action against Gaurav Kumar of Agra and Manoj Kumar of Ludhiana as per law. On the next day i.e. 10.01.2020 after making relevant entries in the test memo form the samples seized from the office of DTDC on 09.01.2020 were sent to Chemical Engineer CRCL Pusa Road New Delhi through Sh. Yogesh Kumar Sharma Sepoy. On the same day i.e. 10.01.2020 Manoj Kumar Yadav Junior Intelligence Officer gave his seizure report to Amit Kumar Tiwary Superintendent. Consequent upon marking of aforesaid disclosure Manoj Kumar Yadav Junior Intelligence Officer on 10.01.2020 along with members of his fresh constituted raiding team reached at the office of DTDC Mathura Road Agra and Gaurav Kumar Aggarwal was called at the DTDC office by their staff members and there he was served BAIL APPLN. 2585 2020 with notice under Section 67 of NDPS Act. On the same day i.e. 10.01.2020 Gaurav Kumar Aggarwal in the office of DTDC office gave his voluntary statement under Section 67 of NDPS Act before Anand Kumar Intelligence Officer. He was fully apprised of the procedure prescribed under Section 67 of NDPS Act however Gaurav Kumar Aggarwal accepted his guilt and stated that on 06.01.2020 he had booked a parcel in the name of Manoj Kumar Campa Cola Chowk Ludhiana Punjab with DTDC courier Sikandra Road Agra containing 50 000 tablets of Tramadol which was purchased by him from Mohit Aggarwal without bill. He admitted that the said parcel contained 50 000 tablets of Tramadol which fall under contraband narcotic drugs were without prescription and bill therefore on the parcel it was mentioned “surgical items”. The said Gaurav Kumar Agarwal further stated that Mohit Aggarwal purchased these medicines from Pramod Jaipuri @ Davinder Khandelwal and gave their mobile numbers. He further disclosed that Pramod Jaipuria lives in Jaipur but his son in law Gaurav Khandelwal used to look after his business in Agra and he had a godown of drugs in Agra and that whenever Pramod Jaipuria visited Agra he lived in Hotel Chanderlok Raja Mandi. He BAIL APPLN. 2585 2020 further disclosed that he knew house and shop of Mohit Aggarwal and can identify them and their places if NCB officials ask him to accompany. Thereafter Gaurav Kumar took the raiding team to Mohit Kumar Aggarwal on whose disclosure raiding team reached the house of Doji Ram where Pramod Kumar Jaipuria @ Davinder Khandelwal was running his godown there the raiding team met one Rambir the watchman who disclosed that the godown belonged to Pramod Kumar Jaipuria @ Davinder Khandelwal who was doing business of medicines and he called him up on his mobile and informed that the NCB team has come to his godown and after hearing this Pramod Kumar Jaipuria @ Davinder Khandelwal disconnected the phone and switched off his mobile. Thereafter upon following the due procedure as per law the search was conducted at the godown and huge quantity of drugs covered under the NDPS Act was seized. On the said day itself notice under Section 67 of the NDPS Act was served upon Mohit Aggarwal. Both Gaurav Kumar Aggarwal and Mohit Aggarwal voluntarily agreed to accompany the raiding team to Delhi. On 10.01.2020 Sachin Kumar Intelligence Officer along with his raiding team headed towards office of DTDC at Ludhiana. When Manoj Kumar reached at DTDC office and asked for his parcel Sachin Kumar BAIL APPLN. 2585 2020 Intelligence Officer spoke to him and told him their purpose of coming there and on asking about the parcel Manoj Kumar stated that he is a whole seller of medicines and is involved in the sale and purchase of medicines and he accepted to have placed an order for 50 000 tablets of Taramol from Gaurav Kumar Aggarwal and that he had come to collect the parcel and also that he had all the relevant documents at his shop Tredwell Health Care and if the NCB officials accompany him to the shop he can show the entire documents. The NCB team members along with local police officials visited his shop and Manoj Kumar showed certain documents which were found to be not relating to narcotics. On verification of those documents it revealed that Manoj Kumar did not have any document with regard to sale and purchase of narcotic drugs. Upon further inspection of stock available at his shop it was further revealed that a huge quantity of different narcotic drugs were available at his shop without any relevant document in that regard and Manoj Kumar admitted to have sold a few without any prescription and bill and so the medicine stock was sealed under the provisions of NDPS Act. On that day i.e. 10.01.2020 Manoj Kumar was served with Notice under Section 67 of NDPS Act and he gave his voluntary statement before Sachin Kumar Intelligence Officer. BAIL APPLN. 2585 2020 9. On the next day i.e. 11.01.2020 petitioner Mohit Kumar Aggarwal gave his voluntary statement under Section 67 of NDPS Act before Sh.R.K. Maurya Intelligence Officer wherein he admitted his guilt and complicity for the commission of offence of this case. He stated that two three years ago he took a shop on rent and started business of medicines and Gaurav Kumar Aggarwal used to buy medicines from his shop. He further stated that Gaurav Kumar Aggarwal had purchased five boxes of Tramodol out of which one box of 50 000 tablets was bought from Pramod Jaipuria. He also admitted that he can identify Pramod Jaipuria and his godown situated in Agra. 10. For the recovered narcotic substances i.e. 50 000 tablets of Tramadol from DTDC courier weighing 20 kgs 6 64 940 tablets capsules weighing 328.82kg 1400 injections amounting to 1.4 ltrs and 80 corex amounting to 8 ltrs syrup seized from Agra & 9 900 tablets weighing 990 gms the seizure memos were prepared by the Intelligence Officers concerned and sent for examination. 11. Consequent upon recovery of contraband and on the basis of voluntary statements Mohit Kumar Aggarwal was arrested on 11.01.2020 for the offences under Sections 8 22 and 29 NDPS Act as per procedure BAIL APPLN. 2585 2020 prescribed. On 12.01.2020 Shri R.K.Maurya Intelligence Officer gave the arrest report of Mohit Kumar Aggarwal under Section 57 of the NDPS Act to Amit Kumar Tiwary Superintendent NCB DZU. 12. Petitioner‟s application for bail was dismissed by the learned trial court vide order dated 21.07.2020 while observing as under: “In present case also the present accused is found connected as per the statement of co accused he purchased the said recovered drugs from the present accused and thereafter at the instance of both the accused huge recovery of contraband was effected. The accused persons were also found connected through mobile phones. The twin conditions envisaged u S 37 are required to be satisfied before granting the bail to the accused. At this stage it cannot be held that there are no reasonable grounds exist that accused is not guilty of the offence alleged. The reasonable ground mean something more than prima facie ground. Merely the factum that there is no documentary evidence is no ground that no prima facie case is made out. The judgment of Surender Khanna as relied by the Ld. Counsel for accused is not applicable at this stage. Apex Court in case titled as Mohd. Fasrin Vs. State Crl. Appeal No. 296 2014 dated 04.09.2019 held that even if confession made to the investigating officers are held to be admissible under Section 67 of Narcotic Drugs BAIL APPLN. 2585 2020 and Psychotropic Substances Act 1985 the Court has to be satisfied that it is a voluntary statement free from any pressure and also that the accused was apprised of his rights before recording the confession. Thus it cannot be held that at this stage statement u S 67 of NDPS Act cannot be looked to see the prima facie case. At this stage this Court is not supposed to appreciate the probative value of the material on record however only has to see the prima facie case. The recovered contraband is commercial in nature thus there is definite bar u S 37 NDPS Act over the release of accused on bail however it cannot be held at this stage there are reasonable grounds to believe that accused is not guilty of the offence and is not likely to commit any offence while on bail. Considering the material on record and in view of the above discussion I found no ground to release the applicant accused Mohit Aggarwal on bail. Hence the present application is dismissed.” 13. At the hearing learned senior counsel for petitioner submitted that the rejection of bail by the trial court is without application of mind as the learned trial court has failed to appreciate that name of petitioner popped up in this case when accused Gaurav Kumar Aggarwal in his voluntary statement took petitioner‟s name and the said voluntary statement was partly BAIL APPLN. 2585 2020 recorded in Agra and partly in Delhi and accused Gaurav Kumar Aggarwal has retracted from his statement at the first available opportunity itself. Learned senior counsel pointed out that accused Gaurav Kumar Aggarwal had taken the NCB team to the shop of petitioner and the shop was searched by the NCB team but nothing incriminating was recovered from the shop. It is next contended by learned senior counsel for petitioner that petitioner was served with notice under Section 67 of NDPS Act and his statement was recorded by R.K.Maurya Intelligence Officer and the petitioner had retracted from the said statement on the first available opportunity. 15. Learned senior counsel also submitted that in the statement of Manoj Kumar of Ludhiana recorded under Section 67 of NDPS Act he has not named petitioner herein and he has retracted from his statement. It has also been pointed out that the tablets and material seized on 09.01.2020 is different from the description of medical tablets details of which have been sought by prosecution vide summon dated 27.04.2020 under Section 67 of NDPS Act and also that details of batch number and manufacturer are not mentioned therein. 16. Leaned senior counsel for petitioner vehemently submitted that apart BAIL APPLN. 2585 2020 from retracted statements of co accused involved in this case no other material evidence has been placed on record to establish petitioner‟s involvement in the offence in question. In support of petitioner‟s case reliance has been placed upon decisions of Constitution Bench of Supreme Court in Hari Charan Kurmi Anr. Vs. State of Bihar6 SCR 623 Kashmira Singh Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh AIR 1952 SC 159 Mohd. Fasrin Vs. State 2019SCC 811 and Surinder Kumar Khanna Vs. Intelligence Officer Directorate of Revenue Intelligence 8 SCC 271. Reliance has also been placed upon recent decision of Hon‟ble Supreme Court in Tofan Singh Vs. State of Tamil Nadu 2020 SCC OnLine SC 882. 18. On the other hand learned Special Public Prosecutor appearing for respondent NCB supported the impugned order dated 21.07.2020 rejecting petitioner‟s bail application and submitted that the offence committed by the petitioner comes under the category of recovery of commercial quantity and since there is an embargo of Section 37 of NDPS Act the present petition deserves to be dismissed. Reliance was placed upon decision of Hon‟ble Supreme Court in State of Kerala & Ors. Vs. Rajesh & Ors.12 SCC BAIL APPLN. 2585 2020 19. Learned Special Public Prosecutor appearing for respondent NCB further submitted that petitioner has tendered his voluntary statement under Section 67 of NDPS Act before the competent officer wherein he has admitted his guilt. He further submitted that the analysis of call detail records of petitioner and other co accused in this case shows criminal conspiracy for their involvement in illicit trafficking of drugs. It was next submitted that statement tendered by petitioner under Section 67 of NDPS Act is admissible in evidence and has evidentiary value as per NDPS Act. Learned Special Public Prosecutor submitted that reliance placed upon various afore noted decision is of no help to the case of petitioner as in those cases the aspect of statement of accused recorded has not been dealt with. Thus dismissal of the present petition is sought by Special Public Prosecutor appearing for respondent NCB. 21. The rival contentions raised by both the sides have been considered. 22. As per the prosecution case 50 000 tablets of Tramadol weighing 20 kgs 6 64 940 tablets Capsules weighing 328.82kg 1400 injections amounting to 1.4 ltrs and 80 corex amounting to 8 ltrs syrup & 9 900 tablets weighing 990 gms were recovered in this case. It is an admitted case of both the sides that name of petitioner popped BAIL APPLN. 2585 2020 up in this case in the statement made by co accused Gaurav Kumar Aggarwal. It is also an admitted case that at the behest of Gaurav Kumar Aggarwal the NCB team visited the shop of petitioner and upon search nothing incriminating was recovered. The solitary ground to involve petitioner in the present case is his statement made under Section 67 of NDPS Act which he had retracted at the first opportunity available to him. 24. Pertinently Section 67 of NDPS Act reads as under: “67. Power to call for information etc. —Any officer referred to in section 42 who is authorised in this behalf by the Central Government or a State Government may during the course of any enquiry in connection with the contravention of any provisions of this Act — a) call for information from any person for the purpose of satisfying himself whether there has been any contravention of the provisions of this Act or any rule or order made thereunder b) require any person to produce or deliver any document or thing useful or relevant to the enquiry c) examine any person acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case.” 25. A perusal of petitioner‟s statement recorded under Section 67 of NDPS Act on 09.01.2020 reveals that Gaurav Kumar Aggarwal used to buy medicines from his shop and on the said day i.e. 09.01.2020 he along with BAIL APPLN. 2585 2020 NCB team came to his shop and introduced him to them and they told him that they had come to inquire about 50 000 tramadol tablets which were sent by Gaurav Kumar Aggarwal to Manoj in Ludhiana and he admitted that a few days ago he had purchased 05 boxes of tramadol tablets from Pradeep Jaipuria illegally which were bought by Gaurav Kumar Aggarwal out of which he had returned 03 boxes due to money crisis and those 03 boxes he had returned to Pradeep Japuria. In his statement petitioner admitted that he along with Gaurav Kumar Aggarwal had escorted the NCB team to the godown of Pradeep Jaipuria. Besides petitioner has admitted that on two three occasions he had sold narcotic tablets purchased from Pradeep Jaipuria to Gaurav Kumar Aggarwal for extra amount of Rs.2 000 . 26. The petitioner‟s statement was recorded for the second time on 10.01.2020 at the NCB office however its copy has not been placed on record. Petitioner had retracted from his statements on the first available opportunity made available to him. 27. Recently the Hon‟ble Supreme Court by majority view while answering to a reference with regard to the evidentiary value of Section 67 of NDPS Act in Tofan Singhhas held as under: “158. We answer the reference by stating: BAIL APPLN. 2585 2020 That the officers who are invested with powers under section 53 of the NDPS Act are “police officers” within the meaning of section 25 of the Evidence Act as a result of which any confessional statement made to them would be barred under the provisions of section 25 of the Evidence Act and cannot be taken into account in order to convict an accused under the NDPS Act. ii) That a statement recorded under section 67 of the NDPS Act cannot be used as a confessional statement in the trial of an offence under the NDPS Act.” In the aforesaid view of the matter the Hon‟ble Supreme Court sent back the appeals and special leave petitions to the Division Benches of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court to hear them in the light of aforesaid view. 29. Reciting a dissenting view in Tofan Singh Hon‟ble Ms. Justice Indira Banerjee observed that any statement made or document or other thing given to an authorised officer referred to in Section 42 of the NDPS Act or an officer invested under Section 53 with the powers of an Officer in Charge for the purpose of investigation of an offence under the said Act in the course of any inquiry investigation or other proceeding may be tendered in evidence in the trial of an offence under the said Act and proved in accordance with law. The Hon‟ble Judge also observed that she BAIL APPLN. 2585 2020 was unable to agree that a statement recorded under Section 67 of the NDPS Act cannot be used against an accused offender in the trial of an offence under the NDPS Act. On this aspect the aforesaid Bench of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court observed as under: “262. An officer empowered under Section 53 with the powers of an Officer in Charge of a Police Station for the investigation of an offence also has the power to make an inquiry. This is clear from the language used in Section 53A(1) of the NDPS Act. The words “A statement made and signed by a person before any officer empowered under Section 53 for the investigation of offences during the course of any inquiry or proceedings by such officer” clinches the issue. The officer empowered under Section 53 with the power of an Officer in Charge of a Police Station can obviously make an inquiry within the meaning of Section 67 to find out whether there has been any contravention of the NDPS Act. A statement made before such an officer in course of any inquiry or other proceeding which is taken down in writing and signed by the person making it may in certain circumstances be relevant for the purpose of proving in any prosecution for an offence under the NDPS Act the truth of the facts it contains.” 30. Further on the value of a confession made by a person Hon‟ble Ms.Justice Indira Banerjee held as under: BAIL APPLN. 2585 2020 “308. A confession made by an accused person is irrelevant in a criminal proceeding if it appears to the Court that the confessions may have been elicited by any inducement threat or promise from a person in authority and sufficient in the opinion of the Court to give the accused person reasonable grounds for supposing that by making the confession he would gain any advantage or avoid any disadvantage in respect of proceedings against him. 309. As observed by this Court the State of Rajasthan v. Raja Ram “confessions may be divided into two classes judicial and extra judicial. Judicial confessions are those which are made before a Magistrate or a Court in the course of judicial proceedings. Extra judicial confessions are those which are made by the party elsewhere than before a Magistrate or Court. Extra judicial confessions are generally those that are made by a party to or before a private individual which includes even a judicial officer in his private capacity. It also includes a Magistrate who is not especially empowered to record confessions under Section 164 of the Code or a Magistrate so empowered but receiving the confession at a stage when Section 164 does not apply. As to extra judicial confessions two questions arise :were they made voluntarily andare they true ”. xxx xxx xxx BAIL APPLN. 2585 2020 “An extra judicial confession if voluntary and true and made in a fit state of mind can be relied upon by the Court. The confession will have to be proved like any other fact. The value of the evidence as to confession like any other evidence depends upon the veracity of the witness to whom it has been made. The value of the evidence as to the confession depends on the reliability of the witness who gives the evidence. It is not open to any court to start with a presumption that extra judicial confession is a weak type of It would depend on the nature of circumstances the time when the confession was made and the credibility of the witnesses who speak to such a xxx xxx xxx “If the evidence relating to extra judicial confession is found credible after being tested on the touchstone of credibility and acceptability it can solely form the basis of conviction. The requirement of corroboration as rightly submitted by the learned counsel for the respondent accused is a matter of prudence and not an invariable rule of law.” 31. With afore noted pertinent observations Hon‟ble Ms. Justice Indira Banerjee held that provisions of Cr.P.C. do not apply to an inquiry investigation under the NDPS Act except to the limited extent provided in BAIL APPLN. 2585 2020 Section 50(5) and 51 of the Act. It was further held that “the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court in Raj Kumar Karwalwhich has reaffirmed the verdict of three Constitution Benches does not require reconsideration and nor does Kanhaiyalalrequire reconsideration.” 32. Keeping in mind the observations made in Tofan Singhand upon a bare reading of petitioner‟s statement recorded on 09.01.2020 it is apparent that petitioner has not admitted that he was a party to the transaction or in possession of recovered and seized contraband substance. Though he has admitted in custody to have illegally traded the tablets under the NDPSbut since no recovery has been affected from his person or shop in this case prosecution can only attempt to prove its case on the basis of circumstantial evidence that is to say by corroborating the call detail record or other material available and reliance cannot be solely placed upon disclosure statement of co accused to keep him behind bars especially when the recoveries of the instance were before the arrest of the petitioner and the statement given by co accused has been retracted at the first available opportunity. 33. Respondent NCB has placed reliance upon Hon‟ble Supreme Court‟s decision in State of Kerala Vs. Rajesh (ii)and Section 29 of NDPS Act and the High Court without noticing Section 37 of the NDPS Act granted bail to the accused on parity basis with other co accused in that case who were already on bail. The Hon‟ble Supreme Court observed that “the High Court had failed to record a finding under Section 37 of the NDPS which is a sine qua non for granting bail to the accused under the NDPS Act”. Appeal preferred by the prosecution was allowed and order of the High Court was set aside and bail granted to the accused was cancelled. 34. Pertinently the provisions of Section 37 of NDPS Act read as under: “37. Offences to be cognizable and non bailable — 1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973— every offence punishable under this Act shall be a) cognizable b) no person accused of an offence punishable for 2[offences under section 19 or section 24 or section 27A and also for offences involving commercial quantity] shall be released on bail or on his own bond unless — i) the Public Prosecutor has been given an opportunity to oppose the application for such release and BAIL APPLN. 2585 2020 where the Public Prosecutor opposes application the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail. 2) The limitations on granting of bail specified in clauseof sub sectionare in addition to the limitations under the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 or any other law for the time being in force on granting of bail.]” In the case in hand investigation is said to be complete. As per impugned order dated 21.07.2020 complaint charge sheet has already been filed however besides confessional statement recorded under Section 67 of NDPS Act no other material is forthcoming. Since no incriminating material was recovered at the instance of petitioner this strengthens the view of this Court that petitioner is not likely to commit offence if released on bail. Moreover nothing stops the prosecution to prove its case on merits during trial. In the aforesaid view of the case requirements under Section 37 of NDPS Act are fulfilled. In the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case without commenting on the merits petitioner is directed to be released forthwith on his furnishing personal bond in the sum of Rs.25 000 and one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of trial court duty magistrate subject to the BAIL APPLN. 2585 2020 condition that: Petitioner shall not directly or indirectly tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses of the case ii) Petitioner shall provide his mobile number to the IO and ensure that he is reachable. 37. The petition is allowed in aforesaid terms. Pending application also 38. A copy of this order be transmitted to the Jail Superintendent concerned and trial court for information and necessary compliance. SURESH KUMAR KAIT) JUDGE stands disposed of.

The instant revision petition is directed against the order dated 27.08.2018 passed by the Additional Session Judge Special JudgeWest District Tis Hazari Court Delhi in Criminal Appeal being CA No. 153 2018 whereby the Additional Session Judge has dismissed the appeal and has affirmed the order dated 26.04.2018 passed by the Metropolitan Magistrate in CC No.8073 2016 convicting the petitioner herein for offences punishable under section 138 of Negotiable Act 1881(Provisio) of N.I. Act read with Section 357(1)(3) of Cr.P.C. The facts leading to the instant revision petition are as under: a) The respondent is a leasing and financing company. The respondent financed a bus for the petitioner by giving a loan. In discharge of the liability the petitioner handed over three cheques drawn on Bank of Punjab Limited. Rajouri Garden Delhi bearing number 327226 dated 13.04.2003 for an amount of Rs. 1 lakh number 327227 dated 28.07.2003 for an amount of Rs. 3 lakhs and number 327338 dated 27.07.2003 for an amount of Rs. 2 84 000 in favor of the respondent. b) When the respondent deposited these cheques they were returned as unpaid dishonored reason \"Funds c) Notice as required under Section 138 of the N.I. Act was issued by the respondent calling upon the petitioner herein to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the notice. The payment was not received and a complaint was filed under Section 138 of the N.I. Act before the court of the Metropolitan Magistrate West District Tis Hazari Court d) Before the Metropolitan Magistrate it was contended by the petitioner herein that he took a loan for purchasing a bus with registration number DL1 PA 5798 and at the time of taking the loan 36 blank signed cheques were given as security towards CRL.REV.P. 774 2018 the repayment of the loan. It is stated that in October 2002 the petitioner herein handed over the vehicle to the respondent company for getting the vehicle converted to CNG and entered into a new lease agreement but neither was the said vehicle returned to the petitioner herein nor were the accounts related to the hire purchase agreement settled. It was stated before the Metropolitan Magistrate that as the vehicle is in the possession of the respondent herein and the cheque given by the petitioner accused had been misused. It was stated before the Metropolitan Magistrate that the bus No.DL1 PA 5798 was re possessed by the respondent. It was also stated the a No Objection Certificate dated 30.08.2003 along with form 35 was issued by the issuing authority and the respondent herein had given a No objection with regard to the bus bearing No.DL1 PA 5798. The Metropolitan Magistrate after examining the documents found that the deposition of the accused petitioner herein is inconsistent with the evidence on record. The Metropolitan Magistrate also found that in relation to bus number DL1 PA 5798 accused petitioner herein had deposed complainant respondent herein has already sold the bus but officer from Transport Department Delhi placed on record the RC which shows that the accused petitioner herein is the owner of the bus. As per the RC bus number DL1 PA 5798 is registered in the name of the accused and NOC has been issued by hypothecatee on 10.09.2003. The Metropolitan CRL.REV.P. 774 2018 Magistrate held that the averments of the accused petitioner herein in relation to the sale of this vehicle despite payment of 13 installments is incorrect as the ownership of the vehicle still vests with the accused petitioner herein. g) The Metropolitan Magistrate after examining the documents came to the conclusion that this case pertains to the bus bearing registration number DL1 P 7279. h) The Metropolitan Magistrate found that the accused petitioner herein and the complainant respondent herein had dealings in relation to two buses. It was found that the petitioner had another bus bearing No. DL1 P 7279 which was under the loan of the Motor & General Finance Ltd. Company in the year 1995. The loan was taken over by the respondent company. The Metropolitan Magistrate held that AR of the complainant deposed that a sum of Rs. 8 Lakhs was lent to the accused in the year 2001 wherein certain payments were made to the accused and the remaining payment was made to MGF India Limited. The Metropolitan Magistrate held that this was consistent with the testimony of the accused wherein he has admitted that he cleared his loan with MGF India Limited in 2001 CW 1 also deposed that one bus was in the name of the accused and the other bus was financed and the amount deposited by the complainant company was against the bus which was already in the name of the accusedThe Metropolitan Magistrate therefore held accused petitioner herein has not been able to rebut the presumption that the cheques had been paid for discharge of The Metropolitan Magistrate by an order dated 26.04.2018 convicted the petitioner herein for offences under Section 138 any liability. of the N.I. Act. m) The above said judgment was challenged before the Additional Session Judge in CA No. 153 2018. After going through the records the Additional Session Judge upheld the judgment dated 02.07.2018 passed by the Metropolitan Magistrate West District Tis Hazari Courts Delhi in CC No.8073 2016 convicting the petitioner and also the order on sentence dated 12.07.2018 passed by the Metropolitan Magistrate West District Tis Hazari Courts Delhi in CC No.8073 2016 imposing simple imprisonment for two months period and fine of Rs. 13 Lakhs. n) The Additional Session Judge after going through the material on record found that the three cheques were issued by the CRL.REV.P. 774 2018 petitioner towards legally enforceable debt due to respondent. Heard Mr. Medhanshu Tripathi learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and Mr. Anuj Soni learned counsel appearing for the respondent. 4. Mr. Medhanshu Tripathi learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the failure on part of the respondent to submit their books of accounts is fatal to the case of the respondent. He would contend that the courts below ought to have drawn adverse inference against the respondent when the respondent deliberately did not produce the books of accounts even though the respondent had undertaken to produce the books of accounts. 5. Mr. Medhanshu Tripathi learned counsel for the petitioner would rely on the judgment of the Supreme Court in M.S. Narayana Menon v. State of Kerala reported as 6 SCC 39 to contend that it was for the complainant respondent herein to produce the books of accounts and without producing the books of accounts it cannot be said that there was a debt due and subsisting and the cheques have been issued for discharge of debt. 6. Mr. Tripathi would further contend that the Metropolitan Magistrate had erred in relying upon the improved testimony of the respondent company. He would further contend that the vehicle had been re possessed and sold and therefore nothing was due and payable. On the other hand Mr. Anuj Soni learned counsel for the respondent would support the support the judgments of the courts below to contend that all the points now being raised have already been dealt with by the Metropolitan Magistrate in his judgment and which has not been disturbed by the appellate Court. Section 118 of the N.I. Act raises a presumption that a cheque is issued for consideration until the contrary is proved. It is well settled CRL.REV.P. 774 2018 position that the initial burden in this regard lies on the accused to prove the non existence of debt by bringing on record such facts and circumstances which would lead the court to believe the non existence of debt either by direct evidence or by preponderance of probabilities. In the present case other than mere ipse dixit of the petitioner that there was no debt due and payable nothing is on record to show that the cheques were not issued for discharge of liability for the bus. The second bus bearing registration No. DL 1 PA 5798 stood in the name of the accused. There is nothing to show that the liability for the first bus bearing registration No. DL1 P 7279 has been discharged. 10. The purpose of introducing Section 138 of the N.I. Act was to bring sanctity in commercial transactions. In Dalmia CementLtd. v. Galaxy Traders & Agencies Ltd. reported as 6 SCC 463 the Supreme Court observed as under: to negotiable “3. The Act was enacted and Section 138 thereof incorporated with a specified object of making a special provision by incorporating a strict liability so far as the cheque a negotiable instrument is concerned. The law law of commercial world legislated to facilitate the activities in trade and commerce making provision of giving sanctity to the instruments of credit which could be deemed to be convertible into money and easily passable from one person to another. In the absence of such instruments including a cheque the trade and commerce activities in the present day world are likely to be adversely affected as it is impracticable for the trading community to carry on with it the bulk of the currency in force. The negotiable instruments are in fact the instruments of credit being convertible on account of legality of being negotiated and are easily passable from one hand to CRL.REV.P. 774 2018 another. To achieve the objectives of the Act the legislature has in its wisdom thought it proper to make such provisions in the Act for conferring such privileges to the mercantile instruments contemplated under it and provide special penalties and procedure in case the obligations under the instruments are not discharged. The laws relating to the Act are therefore required to be interpreted in the light of the objects intended to be achieved by it despite there being deviations from the general law and the procedure provided for the redressal of the grievances to the litigants. Efforts to defeat the objectives of law by resorting to innovative measures and methods are to be discouraged lest it may affect the commercial and mercantile activities in a smooth and healthy manner ultimately affecting the economy of the country.” 12. Two courts below have looked into the entire records of the case and have come to the conclusion that the cheques have been given in discharge of debt. The petitioner only seeks to take advantage of the fact that the respondent did not produce the books of accounts to rebut the initial presumption which was for the petitioner to show that the amount of loan taken by him and the amount that should be repaid in order to discharge the initial burden and the petitioner has failed to discharge the initial onus of 13. The scope of the revision petition under Sections 397 401 Cr.P.C. read with Section 482 Cr.P.C. is extremely narrow. In State v. Manimaran reported as 13 SCC 670 the Supreme Court observed as under: “16. As held in State of Kerala v. Puttumana Illath Jathavedan Namboodiri2 SCC 452 : 1999 SCC275] ordinarily it would not be appropriate CRL.REV.P. 774 2018 In State of Haryana v. Rajmal reported as 14 SCC 326 the Supreme Court observed as under: the courts below recorded for the High Court to reappreciate the evidence and come to its own conclusion on the same when the evidence has already been appreciated by Magistrate as well as by the Sessions Court in appeal. the concurrent findings of fact in our view the High Court was not right in interfering with the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the courts below and the impugned order cannot be sustained.” in upsetting A.P. v. Pituhuk the exercise of the High Court “14. In State Rao9 SCC 537 : 2001 SCC 642] this the revisional Court held jurisdiction of concurrent finding of the facts cannot be accepted when it was without any reference to the evidence on record or to the finding entered by the trial court and the appellate court regarding the evidence in view of the fact that revisional jurisdiction is basically supervisory in nature. It has been also held by this Court in Amar Chand Agarwalla v. Shanti Bose4 SCC 10 : 1973 SCC Cri) 651 : AIR 1973 SC 799] that the revisional jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 439 CrPC is to be exercised only in an exceptional case when there is a glaring defect in the procedure or there is a manifest error on a point of law resulting in a flagrant miscarriage of justice. Report.)” In State of Kerala v. Puttumana Illath Jathavedan Namboodiri reported as 1999) 2 SCC 452 the Supreme Court observed as under: “5. Having examined the impugned judgment of the High CRL.REV.P. 774 2018 Court and bearing in mind the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the parties we have no hesitation to come to the conclusion that in the case in hand the High Court has exceeded its revisional jurisdiction. In its revisional jurisdiction the High Court can call for and examine the record of any proceedings for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the correctness legality or propriety of any finding sentence or order. In other words the jurisdiction is one of supervisory jurisdiction exercised by the High Court for correcting miscarriage of justice. But the said revisional power cannot be equated with the power of an appellate court nor can it be treated even as a second appellate jurisdiction. Ordinarily therefore it would not be appropriate for the High Court to re appreciate the evidence and come to its own conclusion on the same when the evidence has already been appreciated by the Magistrate as well as the Sessions Judge in appeal unless any glaring feature is brought to the notice of the High Court which would otherwise tantamount to gross miscarriage of justice. On scrutinizing the impugned judgment of the High Court from the aforesaid standpoint we have no hesitation to come to the conclusion that the High Court exceeded its jurisdiction in interfering with the conviction of the respondent by re appreciating the oral evidence. The High Court also committed further error in not examining several items of evidence relied upon by the Additional Sessions Judge while confirming conviction of the respondent. In this view of the matter the impugned judgment of the High Court is wholly unsustainable in law and we accordingly set aside the same. The conviction and sentence of the respondent as passed by the Magistrate and affirmed by the Additional Sessions Judge in appeal is confirmed. This appeal is allowed. Bail bonds furnished stand cancelled. The respondent must surrender to serve the sentence.” CRL.REV.P. 774 2018 14. Having gone through the material on record this court does not find that the judgment of the courts below require any interference. The learned counsel for the petitioner has not been able to demonstrate that the findings of the courts below are perverse. The fact that the respondent did not file the books of accounts is not fatal to the case of the respondent. It was open to the petitioner to produce his books of accounts to rebut the presumption and bring out a prima facie case that there was no debt due and payable on the date the cheques were dishonoured. The petitioner has not been able to discharge the initial burden on him to rebut the presumption under Section 118 of the N.I. Act. The fact that the petitioner took financial assistance from the respondent is admitted. The petitioner has not been able to show as to how there was no subsisting debt on the date when the cheques were dishonoured due to insufficiency of funds. 15. No case has been made out which would warrant interference under 16. Accordingly the revision petition is dismissed along with the pending Section 397 401 Cr.P.C. application.

      "IN THE HIGH COURT OF ORISSA CUTTACK BLAPL No.2121 In the matter of an application under section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in connection with R.C. Case No.09(A) of 2019 pending in the Court of Special Judge CBI Court No.I Ashwini Kumar Patra Petitioner Mr. Devashis Panda versus Republic of India Opposite Party Mr. Sarthak Nayak Special Public ProsecutorS.K. SAHOO J. JUSTICE S.K. SAHOO Date of Hearing : 23.04.2021 Date of Judgment: 26.04.2021 The petitioner Ashwini Kumar Patra has filed this application under section 439 of Cr.P.C. for grant of bail in connection with R.C. Case No.09(A) of 2019 pending in the Court of learned Special Judge CBI Court No.I Bhubaneswar in which charge sheet has been submitted under sections 409 420 and 471 read with section 120 B of the Indian Penal Code and section 13(2) read with section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 namely Shri Bhubaneswar Mohapatra the then Chief Manager Shri Ashwini Kumar Patra the then Marketing Officer and Shri Rajesh Kumar Patanga the then Manager entered into a criminal conspiracy with three private builders seven borrowers of housing loan and some unknown bank officials in the year 2017 and by abusing their respective official positions housing loans were sanctioned in favour of the borrowers on the basis of false fictitious documents information including fake fictitious ITRs defective KYC 3 documents information and without verifying the documents by violating the guidelines of the Bank. It is also alleged that the petitioner along with other accused Bank officials without obtaining approved plan legal scrutiny search report etc. released the entire loan amounts in favour of the accused builders on behalf of the borrowers without ensuring completion of construction of the houses BJB Nagar 02 Suryanagar 02 & Jaydeb Vihar 03 in Bhubaneswar reportedly sold by builders GDS Builders Pvt. Ltd. Surnag Builders Pvt. Ltd. and Mrs. Puspanjali Patro). It is also alleged that the disbursed loan amounts were allegedly diverted by the accused builders for other purposes and such act on the part of the petitioner along with others have caused undue wrongful loss to the tune of Rs.5 19 16 340 as on 31.05.2019 to the Bank and corresponding wrongful gain to themselves. The Superintendent of Police CBI ACB Bhubaneswar on receipt of the written complaint and on prima facie finding that the complaint disclosed commission of cognizable offence punishable under sections 120 B 420 467 468 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code and section 13(2) read with section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 registered the same as R.C. No. 09(A) 2019 BBS dated 01.07.2019 and on getting prior approval from the competent authority of the Bank as per section 17 A of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 for initiating CBI investigation against the bank officials into the alleged matter 4 proceeded with the investigation. In course of investigation the investigating officer recorded the statements of the witnesses seized the incriminating documents and arrested the petitioner along with others and submitted charge sheet against the petitioner for commission of offences under sections 409 420 and 471 read with section 120 B of the Indian Penal Code and section 13(2) read with section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 and the allegation that the petitioner conspired with the then Chief Manager of the Bank builder Uma Shankar Patro three other private builders and seven borrowers of housing loans and misappropriated Rs.5 19 16 340 and that all the loans were processed recommended and inspected by the petitioner is not at all correct. He further submitted that out of 6 twenty five charge sheet witnesses who are officials of the Bank I.T.Os Insurance officials GEQD and CBI I.O. only one private charge sheet witness i.e. C.S.W. No.19 namely Aswin Kumar Patro is related to the co accused Uma Shankar Patro who is to prove that all borrowers are either workers known persons relatives of the workers in GDS Builders Pvt. Ltd. or Dwaraka Jewellers in which the builder co accused is a partner. It is further submitted that since investigation has been completed and the petitioner is a local man and he has been dismissed from the services of the Bank there is no chance of his absconding or tampering with the evidence therefore the bail application may be sympathetically considered. Mr. Sarthak Nayak learned Special Public Prosecutor CBI on the other hand filed his written note of argument along with copy of chargesheet and vehemently opposed the prayer for bail and argued that the petitioner had sourced processed and recommended the housing loan accounts in the names of ten borrowers on the basis of fake documents being in conspiracy with other co accused persons. The petitioner initiated the disbursement of the loan amounts from the respective housing loan accounts of the accused borrowers to the bank accounts of the accused builders without obtaining the consent of the borrowers and flouting the bank norms prescribed in respect of disbursement of the loans. It is further contended that the petitioner had made recommendations for the sanction of the loans mentioning the false net worth of the accused borrowers without obtaining 7 supporting documents of assets and liabilities misleading the sanctioning authority for which the Bank suffered a loss to the tune of Rs.2 33 71 963 and much work was pending at the construction site on date. Learned counsel further submitted that the Bank initiated disciplinary action against the petitioner and dismissed him from services of the Bank on finding his complicity and involvement in the alleged act of conspiracy. It is further submitted that though as per the Bank’s circular instructions it is mandatory to forward all the loans involving the mortgage of the property to a Centralized Processing Centre which is functioning in the premises of the Regional Office of the Bank but the petitioner processed the loans and recommended for sanction which was ultimately sanctioned and disbursed directly in the branch thereby entering into a criminal conspiracy. It is contended that the Bank’s Master Circular of Home Loans reveals that all the documents submitted by the borrowers need to be scrutinized verified and checked for their genuineness by the officers of the Bank 8 who will collect and process the loan proposals but in the case in hand all the loan proposals were processed by the petitioner himself in his user name through the Bank’s loan processing software and thus it is obvious that he should collect all the required documents check for their genuineness either directly or logically as per the Bank’s circular before making recommendation for sanction. It is further contended that the petitioner has not even obtained any such documentary proofs towards the assets and liabilities of the borrowers but had mentioned false or fictitious statements while processing the credit information and net worth assessment of the borrowers in the loan proposals which clearly reflects his malafide intention of concealing the facts and deviating the procedures of the Bank. Learned counsel for the CBI further urged that the quantum of misappropriation amount being very high and the petitioner being a local person he is very likely to influence and gain over the witnesses in case he is enlarged on bail and therefore the bail application should be rejected. four flats were in ready to occupy condition but three flats in the names of borrowers namely Smt. Swapna Sikha Shri Manoj Kumar Patra and Shri Ajay Kumar Parida were partially constructed but full loan amounts to the builder from the three loan accounts of the aforesaid borrowers were disbursed by the accused Bank officials. The that 9 further revealed that the aforesaid post sanction inspection reports in the case of three flats located at B. K. Sastry Enclave IRC Village and Jayadev Vihar Bhubaneswar are invalid false as the completed buildings mentioned in the said inspection reports had not yet completed and that full amount of the sanctioned limits in the loan accounts of the borrowers was disbursed by the Bank to the bank account of the company M s. GDS Builders Pvt. Ltd. through transfer mode. The investigation further revealed that Sri Bhubaneswar Mohapatra the then Chief Manager of the Bank had full knowledge of all the disbursements made in the alleged housing loan accounts of the accused borrowers to the bank accounts of the accused builders sellers as he along with the petitioner had signed initialed the respective disbursement vouchers and the signatures initials of Sri Bhubaneswar Mohapatra and the petitioner have been duly identified by the other bank officials who were acquainted with the same and are the chargesheet witnesses in the case. The investigation further revealed that no consent of the borrowers was obtained before debiting from their loan accounts and all the seven housing loan proposals were processed by the petitioner being the Asst. Manager of the Bank and Sri Bhubaneswar Mohapatra the then Chief Manager had sanctioned the loan in the capacity of Branch Manager basing on the recommendations of the petitioner. In the chargesheet it is mentioned that the Bank suffered a total loss of Rs.2 33 71 963 in such 10 act of conspiracy and cheating with a corresponding wrongful gain to the accused persons. So far as the accusation against the petitioner is concerned in the chargesheet it has been summarized as under: a) Non observance of due diligence: amount payments. The petitioner has not observed due diligence mandated by the circular instruction of the Bank) in respect of margin money KYC occupation net worth of the borrower property being purchased as well as income source of the borrower. The petitioner has not obtained any such document to show the payment of the margin money by the borrower. The bank account statements of the borrowers at no point of time has an amount more than Rs.10 000 which shows that they could not afford for such high b) Preparation of actually conducting the inspection: inspection reports without The petitioner has not followed the guidelines of the Bank while conducting the inspections. The pre sanction inspection reports are prepared sitting at the branch itself as admitted by the processing officer during investigation) without actually conducting the inspection. Further the details of occupation and net worth of the borrowers mentioned in the inspection reports are found false. The statements mentioned in the post sanction inspection reports are also found false as no such building structures are found at the site on date. c) Non forwarding of the loan proposals to ULP and sanction at the branch itself: 11 As per the circular instructions of the Bank issued during 2015 the petitioner should forward the loan proposals involving mortgage of property to a special designated loan processing centre Union Loan Pointand should not sanction at the branch without specific permission of the Regional Head. The petitioner has sanctioned all the loans at the branch itself ignoring the instructions of the Bank as specific permission of the Regional Head to sanction the loans is not held on record. Further the ULP is functioning in the premises adjacent to the branch in the same compound. The branch has to conduct due diligence part and submit all the relevant documents to ULP for necessary processing and sanction of the loans. This shows the willful ignorance towards the guidelines of the Bank and involvement of the petitioner in the criminal conspiracy with the builders and others. d) Disbursement of the loans without ensuring the progress of the constructions: The petitioner has not ensured the progress of the constructions and authorized for disbursement of the loan amounts violating the Bank’s instructions in respect of the disbursement of the loans. Further no such documents like consent of the borrower request of the builder are held on record. All the post sanction reports are found false. The processing officer has mentioned in the post sanction reports that a two storied building structure is completed in the project site and finishing work is going on but actually no such structures are found at the site as on date and the statements mentioned in the inspection reports are all false. The petitioner in spite of ensuring the 12 correctness of the reports and progress of the work has authorized for disbursal of the loans. The petitioner has also ignored to apply his mind while disbursing the loans because logically it is not possible to complete the construction within a period of three to eight weeks. But the loans are all disbursed within a period of three or eight weeks from the date of sanction. e) Processing of loans based on false income and net worth of the borrowers: The circular instructions of the Bank mandates the branch officers officials to ensure the genuineness of the income and net worth of the borrowers by supporting documents like Bank statements salary slips income computations balance sheets profit and loss statements documents related to the assets and liabilities and credit information bureau reports etc. The petitioner has not obtained any such documents from the borrowers in the instant case and relied upon the data submitted by the borrowers during the processing stage which is otherwise in violation of the laid down norms. The accusation against the petitioner commission of economic offences which are considered to be grave offences and are to be viewed seriously. Such offences affect the economy of the country as a whole and it involves deep rooted conspiracy and huge loss of public fund. It is committed with cool calculation and deliberate design solely with an eye on personal profit regardless of the consequence to the community. In such type of 13 offences while granting bail the Court has to keep in mind inter alia the larger interest of public and State. The nature and seriousness of an economic offence and its impact on the society are always important considerations in such a case and those aspects must squarely be dealt with by the Court while passing an order on bail applications. 7 Supreme Court Cases 439 State of Gujarat Vrs. MohanLal Jitamalji Porwal reported in 2 Supreme Court Cases 364). held as follows: In the case of Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy it is “34. Economic offences constitute a class apart and need to be visited with a different approach in the matter of bail. The economic offence having deep rooted conspiracies and involving huge loss of public funds need to be viewed seriously and considered as grave offences affecting the economy of the country as a whole and thereby posing serious threat to the financial health of the country. 35. While granting bail the Court has to keep in mind the nature of accusations the nature of evidence in support thereof the severity of the punishment which conviction will entail the character of the accused circumstances which are peculiar to the accused reasonable possibility of securing the presence of the accused at the trial reasonable apprehension of the witnesses being tampered with the larger interests of public State and other similar considerations.” In case of Mohan Lal Jitamalji Porwalit is held as follows: 14 “5.......The entire community is aggrieved if the economic offenders who ruin the economy of the State are not brought to book. A murder may be committed in the heat of moment upon passions being aroused. An economic offence is committed with cool calculation and deliberate design with an eye on personal profit regardless of the consequence to the Community. A disregard for the interest of the community can be manifested only at the cost of forfeiting the trust and faith of the community in the system to administer justice in an even handed manner without fear of criticism from the quarters which view white colour crimes with a permissive eye unmindful of the damage done to the National Economy and National Interest”. Law is well settled that detailed examination of evidence and elaborate discussion on merits of the case need not be undertaken for grant of bail. The Court has to indicate in the bail order reasons for prima facie conclusion why bail was being granted particularly when the accused is charged of having committed a serious offence. In the case of Kalyan Chandra Sarkar Vrs. Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav reported in 2004 Supreme Court Cases1977 it is held as follows: “11....The Court granting bail should exercise its discretion in a judicious manner and not as a matter of course. Though at the stage of granting bail a detailed examination of evidence and elaborate documentation of the merit of the case need not be undertaken there is a need to indicate in such orders reasons for prima facie concluding why bail was being granted particularly where the accused is charged of having committed a serious offence. Any order devoid 15 of such reasons would suffer from non application of mind. It is also necessary for the Court to consider among other circumstances the following factors also before granting bail: a) The nature of accusation and the severity of punishment in case of conviction and the nature of supporting evidence. b) Reasonable apprehension of tampering with the witness or apprehension of threat to the complainant. c) Prima facie satisfaction of the Court in support of the charge.” the case of Ram Govind Upadhyay Vrs. Sudarshan Singh reported in 2002 Supreme Court Cases Criminal) 688 it is held as follows: “3. Grant of bail though being a discretionary order but however calls for exercise of such discretion in a judicious manner and not as a matter of course. Order of bail bereft of any cogent reason cannot be sustained. Needless to record however that the grant of bail is depended upon the contextual facts of the matter being dealt with by the court and facts however do always vary from case to case. While placement of the accused in the society though may be considered but that by itself cannot be a guiding factor in the matter of grant of bail and the same should and ought always to be coupled with other circumstances warranting the grant of bail. The nature of the basic considerations for the grant of bail. More heinous is the crime the greater is the chance of rejection of the bail though however depended on the factual matrix of the matter.” the offence is one of 16 In the case of Prahalad Singh Bhati Vrs. NCT Delhi reported in 2001 Supreme Court Cases674 it is held as follows: conviction will entail “8.....While granting the bail the Court has to keep in mind the nature of accusations the nature of evidence in support thereof the severity of the punishment which character behaviour means and standing of the accused circumstances which are peculiar to the accused reasonable possibility of securing presence of the accused at the trial reasonable apprehension of the witnesses being tampered with the larger interests of the public or state and similar other considerations”. In the case of Sanjay Chandra Vrs. CBI reported in A.I.R. 2012 S.C. 830 it is held as follows: “25 …It is no doubt true that the nature of the charge may be relevant but at the same time the punishment to which the party may be liable if convicted also bears upon the issue. Therefore in determining whether to grant bail both seriousness of the charge and the severity of the punishment should be taken into consideration. The grant or refusal to grant bail lies within the discretion of the Court. The grant or denial is regulated to a large extent by the facts and circumstances of each particular case. But at the same time right to bail is not to be denied merely because of the sentiments of the community against the accused. The primary purposes of bail in a criminal case are to relieve the accused of imprisonment to relieve the State of the 17 burden of keeping him pending the trial and at the same time to keep the accused constructively in the custody of the Court whether before or after conviction to assure that he will submit to the jurisdiction of the Court and be in attendance thereon whenever his presence is required”. Adverting carefully tactical and enthralling contentions raised at the Bar by the learned counsel for the respective parties and looking at the oral as well as documentary evidence available on record I find that there is no dispute to the fact that the petitioner was working as Assistant Manager of the Bank at the relevant point of time. The accusation against him is very serious as it prima facie appears that he has not observed due diligence as mandated by the circular instructions of the Bank in respect of margin money KYC occupation the genuineness of the income and net worth of the borrowers i.e. assets and liabilities with supporting documents etc. status of their properties as well as income source of the borrowers. He has not ensured the progress of the constructions and authorized for disbursement of the loan amounts violating the Bank’s in respect of disbursement of the loans. He appears to have submitted pre sanction inspection reports without actually conducting the inspection and stated that construction of the site has been completed even though no such construction was undertaken. Further the details of the occupation and net worth of the borrowers mentioned in the 18 inspection reports are found to be false. He has sanctioned the loans ignoring the instructions of the Bank without specific permission of the Regional Head in that respect. He has relied upon the data submitted by the borrowers during the processing stage which was in violation of the norms of the Bank. The loans were disbursed within a period of three or eight weeks from the date of sanction. The willful ignorance towards the guidelines of the Bank prima facie indicates the criminal conspiracy of the petitioner with the builders and others. The Bank suffered a total wrongful loss of Rs. 2 33 71 963 excluding applicable interest as per the chargesheet. The contentions raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner for grant of bail to the petitioner are not at all convincing rather I find sufficient force in the argument of the learned counsel for CBI. In view of the foregoing discussions it appears that the crime was committed in a cool calculated and organized manner causing wrongful loss of crores to the Bank. There are prima facie materials showing involvement of the petitioner in the deep rooted conspiracy with other co accused persons to cause such a huge loss to the Bank. In my humble opinion granting bail to the petitioner in economic offences of this nature would be against the larger interest of public and State as it involves criminal misappropriation and cheating of huge amount of public money and there is also reasonable 19 apprehension of tampering with the witnesses. Accordingly the bail application sans merit and hence stands rejected. Before parting I would like to place it on record by way of abundant caution that whatever has been stated hereinabove in this order has been so said only for the purpose of disposing of the prayer for bail made by the petitioner. Nothing contained in this order shall be construed as expression of a final opinion on any of the issues of fact or law arising for decision in the case which shall naturally have to be done by the trial Court at the appropriate stage of the trial. As the restrictions due to resurgence of COVID 19 situation are continuing learned counsel for the parties may utilize a printout of the order available in the High Court’s website at par with certified copy subject to attestation by the concerned advocate in the manner prescribed vide Court’s Notice No. 4587 dated 25th March 2020 as modified by Court’s Notice No. 4798 dated 15th April 2021.

      "Court No. 43 Case : Crl. Mis. Writ Petition No 113620 Petitioner : Respondent : Counsel for Petitioner : Counsel for Respondent : G.A. Ritesh Kumar Singh Salamat Ansari & 3 Others State of U.P. & 3 Others Rakesh Kumar Mishra Hon ble Pankaj Naqvi J Hon ble Vivek Agarwal J Per Pankaj Naqvi J Heard Sri Rakesh Kumar Mishra learned counsel for the petitioners Sri Ritesh Kumar Singh learned counsel for the informant and Sri Deepak Mishra the learned A.G.A. Learned AGA and the learned counsel for the informant do not propose to file any counter affidavit. With the consent of all the petition is being heard and finally decided under the rules of the This writ petition has been filed seeking a writ of mandamus directing the respondent concerned not to arrest the petitioners with a further prayer for quashing the impugned F.I.R. dated 25.08.2019 registered as Case Crime No. 0199 of 2019 under Sections 363 366 352 506 I.P.C. and Section 7 8 POCSO Act Police Station Vishnupura District Kushi Nagar. 1. Salamat Ansari and Priyanka Kharwar @ Alia along with two others have invoked the extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court for seeking quashment of an FIR dated 28.08.2019 as Case Crime No. 0199 of 2019 under Sections 363 366 352 506 IPC and Section 7 8 POCSO Act Police Station Vishnupura Kushinagar on the premise that the couple is of the age of majority competent to contract a marriage performed Nikah on 19.08.2019 as per muslim rites and rituals after Priyanka Kharwar renounced her Hindu identity and embraced Islam. It is further submitted that the couple has been living together as husband and wife since last one year peacefully and happily. It is finally submitted that the FIR lodged by father of petitioner no. 4 Priyanka Kharwar @ Alia is prompted by malice and mischief only with a view to bring an end to martial ties no offences are made out FIR be quashed 2. Learned AGA and learned counsel for the informant vehemently opposed the submissions on the premise that conversion per se for contracting a marriage is prohibited said marriage has no sanctity in law thus this Court should not exercise its extra ordinary jurisdiction in favour of such a couple. They relied on a judgment of a Learned Single Judge in Writ C No. 570614 decided on 16.12.2014 and its recent reiteration in Writ C No. 142820decided on 23.09.2020 3. There is no dispute that the couple has attained the age of majority as Priyanka Kharwar @ Alia s date of birth as per High School Certificateis 07.07.1999 which is an enlisted document in Juvenile Justice Act 2015 for determining the age of an individual coupled with the fact that the entry of the date of birth is not under challenge. The mere fact that this petition is filed and supported by an affidavit of Priyanka Kharwar @ Alia alleged victim goes to show that she is voluntarily living with Salamat Ansari as a 4. Once age of Priyanka Kharwar @ Alia is not in dispute as she is reported to be around 21 years petitioner nos. 1 to 3 cannot be made accused for committing an offence under Section 363 IPC or 366 IPC as victim on her own left her home in order to live with Salamat Ansari. Similarly once Priyanka Kharwar @ Alia is found not to be a juvenile the offence under Seciton 7 8 POCSO Act is also not made out. Allegations relating to offence under Section 352 506 IPC qua petitioner no. 2 and 3 prima facie in view of above background appear to be exaggerated and malafidely motivated with a view to implicate the family of petitioner no. 1 as petitioner no. 2 and 3 are mother and brother of petitioner no. 1 5. We do not see Priyanka Kharwar and Salamat as Hindu and Muslim rather as two grown up individuals who out of their own free will and choice are living together peacefully and happily over a year. The Courts and the Constitutional Courts in particular are enjoined to uphold the life and liberty of an individual guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Right to live with a person of his her choice irrespective of religion professed by them is intrinsic to right to life and personal liberty. Interference in a personal relationship would constitute a serious encroachment into the right to freedom of choice of the two individuals. We fail to understand that if the law permits two persons even of the same sex to live together peacefully then neither any individual nor a family nor even State can have objection to relationship of two major individuals who out of their own free will are living together. Decision of an individual who is of the age of majority to live with an individual of his her choice is strictly a right of an individual and when this right is infringed it would constitute breach of his her fundamental right to life and personal liberty as it includes right to freedom of choice to choose a partner and right to live with dignity as enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution of India 6. The Apex Court in Shafin Jahan v. Asokan K.M16 SCC 368 decided on April 9 2018 held as under 74. The principles which underlie the exercise of the jurisdiction of a court in a habeas corpus petition have been reiterated in several decisions of the Court. In Gian Devi v Superintendent Nari Niketan Delhi31 a three judge Bench observed that where an individual is over eighteen years of age no fetters could be placed on her choice on where to reside or about the person with whom she could stay 7. Whatever may be the date of birth of the petitioner the fact remains that she is at present more than 18 years of age. As the petitioner is sui juris no fetters can be placed upon her choice of the person with whom she is to stay nor can any restriction be imposed regarding the place where she should stay. The court or the relatives of the petitioner can also not substitute their opinion or preference for that of the petitioner in such a matter 75. The ambit of a habeas corpus petition is to trace an individual who is stated to be missing. Once the individual appears before the court and asserts that as a major she or he is not under illegal confinement which the court finds to be a free expression of will that would conclude the exercise of the jurisdiction. In Girish v Radhamony a two judge Bench of this Court observed thus 3 In a habeas corpus petition all that is required is to find out and produce in court the person who is stated to be missing. Once the person appeared and she stated that she had gone of her own free will the High Court had no further jurisdiction to pass the impugned order in exercise of its writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution.\" 76. In Lata Singh v State of U.P Bench of two judges took judicial notice of the harassment threat and violence meted out to young women and men who marry outside their caste or faith. The court observed that our society is emerging through a crucial transformational period and the court cannot remain silent upon such matters of grave concern. In the view of the court 17 This is a free and democratic country and once a person becomes a major he or she can marry whosoever he she likes. If the parents of the boy or girl do not approve of such inter caste or inter religious marriage the maximum they can do is that they can cut off social relations with the son or the daughter but they cannot give threats or commit or instigate acts of violence and cannot harass the person who undergoes such inter caste or inter religious marriage. We therefore direct that the administration police authorities throughout the country will see to it that if any boy or girl who is a major undergoes inter caste or inter religious marriage with a woman or man who is a major the couple is not harassed by anyone nor subjected to threats or acts of violence and anyone who gives such threats or harasses or commits acts of violence either himself or at his instigation is taken to task by instituting criminal proceedings by the police against such persons and further stern action is taken against such persons as provided by law.\" this Court adverted to the social evil of honour killings as being but a reflection of a feudal mindset which is a slur on the nation 78. In a more recent decision of a three judge Bench in Soni Gerry v Gerry Douglas this Court dealt with a case where the daughter of the appellant and respondent who was a major had expressed a desire to reside in Kuwait where she was pursuing her education with her father This Court observed thus 9 She has without any hesitation clearly stated that she intends to go back to Kuwait to pursue her career. In such a situation we are of the considered opinion that as a major she is entitled to exercise her choice and freedom and the Court cannot get into the aspect whether she has been forced by the father or not. There may be ample reasons on her behalf to go back to her father in Kuwait but we are not concerned with her reasons. What she has stated before the Court that alone matters and that is the heart of the reasoning for this Court which keeps all controversies at bay 10. It needs no special emphasis to state that attaining the age of majority in an individual s life has its own significance. She He is entitled to make her his choice The courts cannot as long as the choice remains assume the role of parens patriae. The daughter is entitled to enjoy her freedom as the law permits and the court should not assume the role of a super guardian being moved by any kind of sentiment of the mother or the egotism of the father. We say so without any reservation 79. These principles emerge from a succession of judicial decisions. Fundamental to them is the judgment of a Constitution bench of this Court in Kanu Sanyal v District Magistrate Darjeeling 7. A perusal of the aforesaid judgment manifests that the Apex Court has consistently respected the liberty of an individual who has attained the age of majority 8. The Apex Court in Shakti Vahini Vs. Union of India7 SCC 192 came down heavily on the perpetrators of \"honour killings\" which the Court found not only horrific and barbaric but also interfering with the right to choose a life partner and the dignity of an individual. The Apex Court held as under: 44. The concept of liberty has to be weighed and tested on the touchstone of constitutional sensitivity protection and the values it stands for. It is the obligation of the Constitutional Courts as the sentinel on qui vive to zealously guard the right to liberty of an individual as the dignified existence of an individual has an inseparable association with liberty. Without sustenance of liberty subject to constitutionally valid provisions of law the life of a person is comparable to the living dead having to endure cruelty and torture without protest and tolerate imposition of thoughts and ideas without a voice to dissent or record a disagreement. The fundamental feature of dignified existence is to assert for dignity that has the spark of divinity and the realization of choice within the parameters of law without any kind of subjugation. The purpose of laying stress on the concepts of individual dignity and choice within the framework of liberty is of paramount importance. We may clearly and emphatically state that life and liberty sans dignity and choice is a phenomenon that allows hollowness to enter into the constitutional recognition of identity of a person.Act 1994(See : Voluntary Health Association of Punjab v. Union of India and others12 and Voluntary Health Association of Punjab v. Union of India and 47. The first argument deserves to be rejected without much discussion. Suffice it to say the same relates to the recognition of matrimonial status. If it is prohibited in law law shall take note of it when the courts are approached Similarly PCPNDT Act is a complete code. That apart the concern of this Court in spreading awareness to sustain sex ratio is not to go for sex determination and resultantly female foeticide. It has nothing to do with the institution of marriage.\"that even if a marriage is prohibited in law same shall be taken note of only when the courts are approached for recognition of such marriage which finds further corroboration in the case of NandaKumar vs. State of Kerala 16 SCC 602 which after relying upon Shafin Jahanheld that on attaining majority an individual is entitled to make his her choice which is pivotal and cannot be infringed by anyone. The relevant paragraphs are quoted “7. A neat submission which is made by the learned counsel for the appellants is that the High Court has adopted an approach which is not permissible in law by going into the validity of marriage. It is submitted that when Thushara is admittedly a major i.e. more than 18 years of age she has right to live wherever she wants to or move as per her choice. As she is not a minor daughter of respondent No. 4 “custody” of Thushara could not be entrusted to him. 8. Learned counsel for the appellants is right in his submission. Even the counsel for the State did not dispute the aforesaid position in law and in fact supported this submission of the learned counsel for the 12. The Court also emphasised due importance to the right of an adult person which the Constitution accords to an adult person as under 10 SCC 1 while deciding the issue of right to privacy held as under: 298. Privacy of the individual is an essential aspect of dignity. Dignity has both an intrinsic and instrumental value. As an intrinsic value human dignity is an entitlement or a constitutionally protected interest in itself. In its instrumental facet dignity and freedom are inseparably inter twined each being a facilitative tool to achieve the other. The ability of the individual to protect a zone of privacy enables the realization of the full value of life and liberty. Liberty has a broader meaning of which privacy is a subset. All liberties may not be exercised in privacy. Yet others can be fulfilled only within a private space. Privacy enables the individual to retain the autonomy of the body and mind The autonomy of the individual is the ability to make decisions on vital matters of concern to life. Privacy has not been couched as an independent fundamental right. But that does not detract from the constitutional protection afforded to it once the true nature of privacy and its relationship with those fundamental rights which are expressly protected is understood. Privacy lies across the spectrum of protected freedoms. The guarantee of equality is a guarantee against arbitrary state action. It prevents the state from discriminating between individuals. The destruction by the state of a sanctified personal space whether of the body or of the mind is violative of the guarantee against arbitrary state action. Privacy of the body entitles an individual to the integrity of the physical aspects of personhood The intersection between one s mental integrity and privacy entitles the individual to freedom of thought the freedom to believe in what is right and the freedom of self determination. When these guarantees intersect with gender they create a private space which protects all those elements which are crucial to gender identity The family marriage procreation and sexual orientation are all integral to the dignity of the individual. Above all the privacy of the individual recognises an inviolable right to determine how freedom shall be exercised. An individual may perceive that the best form of expression is to remain silent Silence postulates a realm of privacy. An artist finds reflection of the soul in a creative endeavour. A writer expresses the outcome of a process of thought. A musician contemplates upon notes which musically lead to silence. The silence which lies within reflects on the ability to choose how to convey thoughts and ideas or interact with others. These are crucial aspects of personhood. The freedoms Under Article 19 can be fulfilled where the individual is entitled to decide upon his or her preferences. Read in conjunction with Article 21 liberty enables the individual to have a choice of preferences on various facets of life including what and how one will eat the way one will dress the faith one will espouse and a myriad other matters on which autonomy and self determination require a choice to be made within the privacy of the mind. The constitutional right to the freedom of religion Under Article 25 has implicit within it the ability to choose a faith and the freedom to express or not express those choices to the world. These are some illustrations of the manner in which privacy facilitates freedom and is intrinsic to the exercise of liberty. The Constitution does not contain a separate Article telling us that privacy has been declared to be a fundamental right. Nor have we tagged the provisions of Part III with an alpha suffixed right of privacy: this is not an act of judicial redrafting Dignity cannot exist without privacy. Both reside within the inalienable values of life liberty and freedom which the Constitution has recognised. Privacy is the ultimate expression of the sanctity of the individual. It is a constitutional value which straddles across the spectrum of fundamental rights and protects for the individual a zone of choice and self determination 299. Privacy represents the core of the human personality and recognises the ability of each individual to make choices and to take decisions governing matters intimate and personal. Yet it is necessary to acknowledge that individuals live in communities and work in communities. Their personalities affect and in turn are shaped by their social environment. The individual is not a hermit. The lives of individuals are as much a social phenomenon. In their interactions with others individuals are constantly engaged in behavioural patterns and in relationships impacting on the rest of society. Equally the life of the individual is being consistently shaped by cultural and social values imbibed from living in the community 323. Privacy includes at its core the preservation of personal intimacies the sanctity of family life marriage procreation the home and sexual orientation. Privacy also connotes a right to be left alone. Privacy safeguards individual autonomy and recognises the ability of the individual to control vital aspects of his or her life. Personal choices governing a way of life are intrinsic to privacy. Privacy protects heterogeneity and recognises the plurality and diversity of our culture. While the legitimate expectation of privacy may vary from the intimate zone to the private zone and from the private to the public arenas it is important to underscore that privacy is not lost or surrendered merely because the individual is in a public place. Privacy attaches to the person since it is an essential facet of the dignity of the human being 12.

We find from the judgement in Noor Jahan’s case that no doubt the ladies in question could not authenticate their alleged conversion as they were unable to show the knowledge regarding the basic tenets of Islam the writ court against the above background held that the alleged marriage was illegal as it was performed after a conversion which could not be justified in law. 14. We lest not forget that couples in Noor Jahan and other cognate petitions preferred a joint petition on the basis of alleged conversion of one of the partners. Once the alleged conversion was under clout the Constitutional Court was obliged to ascertain the wish and desire of the girls as they were above the age of 18 years. To disregard the choice of a person who is of the age of majority would not only be antithetic to the freedom of choice of a grown up individual but would also be a threat to the concept of unity in diversity. An individual on attaining majority is statutorily conferred a right to choose a partner which if denied would not only affect his her human right but also his her right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. We say so for the reason that irrespective of the conversion being under clout the mere fact that the couple was living together the alleged relationship can very well be classified as a relationship in the nature of marriage distinct from the relationship arising out of marriage in view of the provisions of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005. 15. The judgment in Priyanshi followed Noor Jahan supra). None of these judgments dealt with the issue of life and liberty of two matured individuals in choosing a partner or their right to freedom of choice as to with whom they would like to live. We hold the judgments in Noor Jahan and Priyanshi as not laying good law 16. We before parting wish to reiterate that we are quashing the FIR primarily on the ground that no offences are made out as discussed above as also the fact that two grown up individuals are before us living together for over a year of their own free will and choice. The ultimate contention on behalf of the informant was that he be afforded visiting rights to meet his daughter. Once petitioner no. 4 has attained majority then it is her choice as to whom she would like to meet. We however expect the daughter to extend all due courtseys and respect to her family 17. We clarify that while deciding this petition we have not commented upon the validity of alleged marriage conversion. 18. In view of above discussion the writ petition succeeds and is allowed. The F.I.R. dated 25.08.2019 registered as Case Crime No 01919 under Sections 363 366 352 506 IPC and Section 7 8 POCSO Act Police Station Vishunpura District Kushi Nagar as well as all consequential proceedings are hereby quashed.

      "IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI Pronounced on: 05.02.2021 AMIT KUMAR SHRIVASTAVA Petitioner in person. Petitioner W.P.(C) 3701 2018 CENTRAL INFORMATION COMMISSION NEW DELHI Through Mr.Amit Bansal Sr. Standing counsel with Ms. Manisha Singh Adv. Respondent. HON BLE MR. JUSTICE JAYANT NATH JAYANT NATH J. This writ petition is filed seeking a writ order or direction to impugn the order dated 15.01.2018 passed by the Central Information Commission The case of the petitioner is that he filed an RTI Application on 05.09.2016 under Rule 6 of the Right to Information Act 2005seeking disclosure of point wise information which was mentioned at serial No. 5(i) to 5(xxv) of the said application. It is claimed that the CPIO did not provide correct information in respect of point 5(i) of the RTI application. The CPIO hid the cases registered under IPC PC Act. It is also claimed that the CPIO misled regarding the other issues. W.P.(C) 3701 2018 Information was not disclosed under Section 8(1)of the RTI Act. The petitioner filed a first appeal on 10.10.2016 before the First Appellate Authority. It is stated that the Appellate Authority did not decide the appeal of the petitioner in the defined period. The petitioner filed a second appeal before the Second Appellate Authority CIC. It is the grievance of the petitioner that during the hearing the respondent believed the verbal submissions of the CPIO instead of the written submissions of the petitioner and allowed them to sustain their stand for non disclosure of the information in respect of all the points by claiming exemption under Section 8(1)of the RTI Act. Hence the present writ petition. I have heard the petitioner in person and learned counsel for the respondent. Both the parties have also filed their written submissions which I have perused. At the outset I may point out that a close look at the writ petition shows that there is suppression of material and vital facts by the petitioner in the present writ petition. A perusal of the impugned order dated 15.01.2018 of the CIC shows that there are serious and grave allegations and proceedings including criminal proceedings and departmental proceedings pending against the petitioner. None of this has been mentioned in the present writ petition. As per the impugned order a case was registered against the petitioner by CBI New Delhi on 05.05.2012 on the allegation of criminal conspiracy of cheating by impersonation demand of illegal gratification and misuse of official position. The petitioner was taken into custody by CBI and was remanded to judicial custody by the CBI Special Court on 25.05.2012. The petitioner was released on bail vide order dated 23.08.2012 W.P.(C) 3701 2018 by the ACMM Patiala House Court on a personal bond and surety bond of Rs. 50 000 . The petitioner was under suspension w.e.f. 24.05.2012 under the relevant provisions of CCS Rules 1965. A charge sheet was filed by CBI against the petitioner after due investigation. The concerned court is said to have taken cognizance of the offence on 16.08.2012. Further the petitioner was placed under deemed suspension suo moto by Department. The suspension was subsequently revoked on 10.03.2015 on the recommendations of the Suspension Review Committee. Further as recommended by the Investigating Agency and DG a charge sheet was issued to the petitioner on 13.08.2013 for major penalty under CCSAct 1956. The impugned order notes that the Departmental and CBI inquiry has not attained finality. None of the above aspects has been mentioned in the present writ petition. These facts give the full background of the case and the RTI application filed. This suppression of facts itself in my opinion is sufficient to dismiss the writ petition. In this context reference may be had to the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Prestige Lights Limited vs. State Bank of India 8 SCC 449 where the Supreme Court held as follows: the High Court under Article 226 of “33. It is thus clear that though the appellant Company had Constitution it had not candidly stated all the facts to the Court. The High Court is exercising discretionary and extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. Over and above a court of law is also a court of equity. It is therefore of utmost necessity that when a party approaches a High Court he must place all the facts before the Court without any reservation. If there is suppression of material facts on the part of the applicant or twisted facts have been placed before the W.P.(C) 3701 2018 Court the writ court may refuse to entertain the petition and dismiss it without entering into merits of the matter.” However I have examined the impugned order of the CIC on merits. In the interest of justice I have chosen to decide the present case of its merits. The petitioner filed the RTI application on 05.09.2016 posing 25 queries which read as follows: “5. Particular of information required A) Details of information required: i) Please provide me the list cases which were registered against officer staff of your office alongwith sections of IPC PC Act. ii) Please provide the Name of Officers who has been directed to support the investigation of investigating agency and copy of letter thereof. iii) Please provide the bill no. of four consecutive month of Pay of the officer after direction stated in clauseiv) Please provide the date of joining and copy of joining report of the officer after compliance of direction given in clausePlease provide the copy of all communication(letters) between department and investigating agency of above office mentioned in clausevi) Please provide the date of suspension of the officer mentioned in clausevii) Is the suspension mentioned in clauseresulted to the direction of investigating agency viii) If yes then provide me copy thereof. ix) Is suspension of officer Clause reviewed every three month x) If yes provide me dates of all minutes of suspension review committee and legible copy all minutes of suspension review xi) Is the officer suspended in clausehave been revoked xii) What is the total period of suspension of the officer who have been revoked clauseW.P.(C) 3701 2018 xiii) Provide me copy fundamental rule by which pay officer clauseis fixed. xiv) Is any order passed under rule clausexv) If yes provide me copy thereof. xvi) If not provide me manner of treatment of pay as per rule clausexvii) Is regular increment of officer mention in clausehas been stopped. xviii) If yes provide me copy thereof. xix) If no provide me copy of all periodical increment sheet of the officer mentioned clausefrom 2012. xx) Is the officer mentioned in clauserquested to revoke xxi) If yes provide me dates when he requested to revoke and also provide me copy of reply thereof alongwith copy of note xxii) Is there any direction issued to stop payment of suspension period officer mentioned in clausexxiii) Provide copy of Rule and order to stop the increment suspension period. xxiv) Provide the list and amount of increments w.e.f. 2011 of officer mentioned in clauseyearwise. xxv) Provide me copy of note sheet of file no. II 10(3)Cus Vig. 12 and II 10(3)Cus Vig 12 pt .” A perusal of the above application shows that the same is vague and confusing. The entire focus of the application is on query 5(ii) namely the name of the officer who has been directed to support the investigation of the investigating agency and copy of the letter thereof. Numerous queries are raised regarding the said alleged officer who has been directed to support the investigation of the investigating agency. 10. The impugned order of the CIC has dismissed the appeal of the petitioner holding that the proceedings initiated by CBI are pending in the appropriate criminal court. Disciplinary proceedings against the petitioner are pending before the concerned Disciplinary Authority and hence the W.P.(C) 3701 2018 matter is covered under Section 8(1)of the RTI Act. 11. Section 8(1)of the RTI Act 2005 reads as follows: “Section 8. Exemption from disclosure of information.Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act there shall be no obligation to give any citizen investigation or apprehension or prosecution of offenders information which would the process of I may see how Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act has been interpreted by this court. A Division Bench of this Court in Director of Income Tax Investigation) and Ors. vs. Bhagat Singh & Ors. MANU DE 9178 2007 held as follows: “8.Information sought for by the respondent No. 1 relates to fate of his complaint made in September 2003 action taken thereon after recording of statement of Ms. Saroj Nirmal and whether Ms. Saroj Nirmal has any other source of income other than teaching in a private school. This information can be supplied as necessary investigation on these aspects has been undertaken during last four years by the Director of Income Tax Investigation). In fact proceedings before the said Director have drawn to a close and the matter is now with the ITO i.e. the Assessing Officer. Under Section 8(1)(h) information can be withheld if it would impede investigation apprehension or prosecution of offenders. It is for the appellant to show how and why investigation will be impeded by disclosing information to the appellant. General statements are not enough. Apprehension should be based on some ground or reason. Information has been sought for by the complainant and not the assessed. Nature of information is not such which interferes with the investigation or helps the assessed. Information may help the W.P.(C) 3701 2018 respondent No. 1 from absolving himself in the criminal trial. It appears that the appellant has held back information and delaying the proceedings for which the respondent No. 1 felt aggrieved and filed the aforesaid writ petition in this Court. We also find no reason as to why the aforesaid information should not be supplied to the respondent No. 1. In the grounds of appeal it is stated that the appellant is ready and willing to disclose all the records once the same is summoned by the criminal court where proceedings under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code are pending. If that is the stand of the appellant we find no reason as to why the aforesaid information cannot be furnished at investigation process is not going to be hampered in any manner and particularly in view of the fact that such information is being furnished only after the investigation process is complete as far as Director of Income Tax Investigation) is concerned. It has not been explained in what manner and how information asked for and directed will hamper the assessment proceedings.” this stage as In Union of India vs. Manjit Singh Bali 2018 SCC OnLine Del. 10394 a Coordinate Bench of this court held as follows: “22. The next question to be examined is whether the denial of information sought for by the respondent is justified in terms of Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act. Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act is set out below for ready reference:— information. “8. Exemption from disclosure of Notwithstanding anything contained in the Act there shall be no obligation to give any citizen h) information which would impede the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of offenders ” xxxxx W.P.(C) 3701 2018 23. A plain reading of the aforesaid provision indicates that in order to deny information under Clauseof Section 8(1) of the RTI Act it must be established that the information sought is one which would impede the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of the offenders. In the facts of the present case a charge sheet has already been filed and therefore the investigation stage is now over. Thus in order for the petitioner to claim exemption from disclosure under Clause h) of Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act it would be essential for the petitioner to indicate as to how such information would impede the investigation or apprehension or prosecution of the offender. In Director of Income Tax v. Bhagat Singha Division Bench of this Court had observed as “Under Section 8(1)(h) information can be withheld if it would impede investigation apprehension or prosecution of offenders. It is for the appellant to show how and why investigation will be impeded by disclosing information to the appellant. General statements are not enough. Apprehension should be based on some ground or 24. In the present case the petitioner has not indicated any possible reason or ground to establish that the disclosure of information as sought by prosecution of the offender. It is also relevant to observe that denial of any information available with a public authority which could assist an alleged offender from establishing his innocence or for pursuing his defence may in fact impede the course of justice. After the investigations are complete the information as sought by the respondent can be denied under Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act only if the public authority apprehends that such disclosure would interfere with the course of prosecution or in apprehending the offenders. It will not be open for the public authority to deny information on the ground that such information may assist the offender in pursuing his defence3701 2018 not the import of Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act. 25. It is also necessary to bear in mind that the RTI Act is a statutory expression of one of the facets of Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India and any exclusionary clause under the RTI Act must be construed keeping in view the object for providing such exclusion. By virtue of Article 19(2) of the Constitution of India reasonable restrictions in exercise of rights under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India are sustainable if they are in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India the security of the state friendly relations with foreign states public order decency or morality or in relation to contempt of court defamation or incitement to an offence. The exclusion under Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act information which would impede process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of the offenders has to be read in conjunction with Article 19(2) of the Constitution of India. Such denial must be reasonable and in the interest of public 14. Reference may also be had to a judgment of another Coordinate Bench of this court in the case of Bhagat Singh vs. Chief Information Commissioner & Ors. 100 DRJ 63 where the court held as follows: “13. Access to information under Section 3 of the Act is the rule and exemptions under Section 8 the exception. Section 8 being a restriction on this fundamental right must therefore is to be strictly construed. It should not be interpreted in manner as to shadow the very right itself. Under Section 8 exemption from releasing information is granted if it would impede the process of investigation or the prosecution of the offenders. It is apparent that the mere existence of an investigation process cannot be a ground for refusal of the information the authority withholding information must show satisfactory reasons as to why the release of such information would hamper the investigation process. Such reasons should be germane and the opinion of the process being hampered should be reasonable W.P.(C) 3701 2018 and based on some material. Sans this consideration Section 8 1)and other such provisions would become the haven for dodging demands for information. 14. A rights based enactment is akin to a welfare measure like the Act should receive a liberal interpretation. The contextual background and history of the Act is such that the exemptions outlined in Section 8 relieving the authorities from the obligation to provide information constitute restrictions on the exercise of the rights provided by it. Therefore such exemption provisions have to be construed in their terms there See Nathi Devi v. Radha Devi Gupta 2005SCC 201 : 2005DRJ 518[SC] B.R. Kapoor v. State of Tamil Nadu 2001 SCC 231 and V. Tulasamma v. Sesha Reddy 1977 SCC 99). Adopting a different approach would result in narrowing the rights and approving a judicially mandated class of restriction on the rights under the Act which is unwarranted.” this view 15. Similarly in B.S. Mathur vs. Public Information Officer of Delhi High Court 125 DRJ 508 the case pertained to the petitioner therein who was a member of the Delhi Higher Judicial Service. The Full Court decided to place him under suspension pending disciplinary action. This court held as follows: its objects and reasons indicate “19. The question that arises for consideration has already been formulated in the Court s order dated 21st April 2011: Whether the disclosure of the information sought by the Petitioner to the extent not supplied to him yet would “impede the investigation” in terms of Section 8(1)(h) RTI Act” The scheme of the RTI that disclosure of Act information is the rule and non disclosure the exception. A public authority which seeks to withhold information available with it has to show that the information sought is of the nature specified in Section 8 RTI Act. As regards Section 8(1)(h) RTI Act which is the only provision invoked by the Respondent to deny the Petitioner the information sought by him it will have W.P.(C) 3701 2018 to be shown by the public authority that the information sought “would impede the process of investigation.” The mere reproducing of the wording of the statute would not be sufficient when recourse is had to Section 8(1)(h) RTI Act. The burden is on the public authority to show in what manner the disclosure of such information would ‘impede’ the investigation. Even if one went by the interpretation placed by this Court in W.P.(C) No. Additional Commissioner of Police 7930 of 2009 Crime) v. CIC decision dated 30th November 2009] that the word “impede” would “mean anything which would hamper and interfere with the procedure followed in the investigation and have the effect to hold back the progress of investigation” it has still to be demonstrated by the public authority that the information if disclosed would indeed “hamper” or “interfere” with the investigation which in this case is the second enquiry.” 16. What follows from the legal position is that where a public authority takes recourse to Section 8(h) of the RTI Act to withhold information the burden is on the public authority to show that in what manner disclosure of such information could impede the investigation. The word ‘impede’ would mean anything that would hamper or interfere with the investigation or prosecution of the offender. 17. A perusal of the impugned order passed by the CIC shows that it relies upon the other orders passed by the Coordinate Benches of the CIC. It notes that in criminal law an investigation is completed with the filing of the charge sheet in an appropriate court by an investigating agency but in cases of vigilance related inquiries and disciplinary matters the word ‘investigation’ used in Section 8 (h) of the Act should be construed rather broadly and should include all enquiries verification of records and assessments. In all such cases the enquiry or the investigation should be taken as completed only after the competent authority makes a prima facie W.P.(C) 3701 2018 determination about presence or absence of guilt on receipt of the investigation enquiry report from the investigating enquiry officer. Based on the said position the impugned order has accepted the plea of the respondent and disallowed the information under Section 8(h) of the RTI Act. 18. As noted above the legal position as settled by this court is that cogent reasons have to be given by the public authority as to how and why the investigation or prosecution will get impaired or hampered by giving the information in question. In the impugned order there is no attempt made whatsoever to show as to how giving the information sought for would hamper the investigation and the on going disciplinary proceedings. The impugned order concludes that a charge sheet has been filed in the criminal case by the CBI but in the disciplinary proceedings the matter is still pending. Based on this fact simplicitor the impugned order accepts the plea of the respondent and holds that the Section 8 (h) is attracted and the respondents are justified in not giving information to the petitioner. No reasons are spelt out as to how the investigation or prosecution will be hampered. 19. Accordingly in my opinion the order has taken a stand which is contrary to the settled legal position by this court as noted above. I accordingly quash the impugned order of CIC and remand the matter back to CIC for consideration afresh in terms of the above noted legal position. 20. The petition stands disposed of accordingly.

      "Reportable IN THE CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION Civil Appeal No 10521 Arising out of SLP(C) No 57517) Chief General ManagerM P Power Trading Co Ltd & Anr Appellant(s) Narmada Equipments Pvt Ltd JUDGMENT Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud J Leave granted. This appeal arises from a judgment and order of a learned Single Judge of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh dated 30 November 2016 where it appointed an Arbitrator in the dispute between the parties in an application1 filed by the respondent under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 19962. The genesis of the matter is from when the Madhya Pradesh Electricity Board3 entered into a Power Purchase Agreement4 on 20 May 1999 with the respondent. “AC No 15” “1996 Act” 2 Under the PPA the respondent was to establish a mini hydro electric project on a built and operate basis. However the PPA was terminated on 27 September 2001 by the Board. The respondent initially filed a writ petition5 challenging the termination of the PPA. The High Court by its order dated 4 November 2009 declined to entertain the petition in view of an arbitration agreement contained in Clause 12.36 of the PPA. Thereafter the respondent filed a review petition7which was dismissed by the High Court by an order dated 10 December 2009. As a consequence of the orders dated 4 November 2009 and 10 December 2009 on 28 December 2009 the respondent issued a notice to the Board under Clause 12.1 of the PPA seeking to resolve the dispute by mutual discussion. Since the respondent did not receive a reply to the notice dated 28 December 2009 from the Board on 30 May 2011 the respondent issued another notice to the Board invoking arbitration under Clause 12.3 of the PPA. In the notice the respondent stated that if the Board did not act upon the notice within 30 days of its receipt it would approach the High Court under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act. Having received no reply from the Board an application8 was filed under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act by the respondent seeking the appointment of an arbitrator. The High Court by its order dated 21 January 2014 recorded that the respondent “WP No 26402” “12.3 Arbitration: a) If dispute cannot be salted within Thirtyby section 12.1 andto Conciliation is not elected by the Parties pursuant to Section 12.2 of if a Parties so requests in accordance with Section 12.2 the Dispute shall in dally be settled by an Umpire to be appointed by two arbitrators one to be appointed by the Board and other by the Company Provisions of the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 9or any enactment that replaces the said Act) shall apply in such arbitrator. The arbitration proceedings shall be held at head Quarter of the Board i.e. at Jabalpur. b) The award rendered shall apportion the costs of the arbitration. c) The award rendered in any arbitration commended here under shall be final conclusive and binding upon the Parties and award may be entered in any Court having jurisdiction as darned under article 15.1.” “Review Petition No 7109” “AC No 711” 3 and the appellant had agreed to nominate their arbitrators and observed that the two arbitrators would proceed to appoint a third arbitrator in accordance with the procedure in Clause 12.3(a) of the PPA. The nominated Arbitrators fixed their first meeting on 7 May 2014 when both parties appeared and the Arbitrators’ fee was fixed. However the Arbitrators by a letter dated 7 July 2014 highlighted their inability to proceed with the arbitration proceedings on the ground that their fees had not been paid. Thereafter the respondent filed AC No 15 on 8 December 2014 seeking the appointment of an arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act. This application was opposed by the appellant on the ground that in view of the provisions of Section 86(1)(f) of the Electricity Act 20039 it was the State Electricity Commission which was vested with the exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate upon disputes between licensees and generating companies. By the impugned judgment and order dated 30 November 2016 the Single Judge of the High Court allowed the application filed by the respondent under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act. The Single Judge held that the remedies under Section 86(1)(f) of the 2003 Act and under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act are independent of each other and it was open to the High Court to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 11(6). The appellant now comes before this Court in appeal. The submission of the appellant which has been urged before this Court by Mr Varun Chopra learned counsel is that the view which has been taken by the High Court is contrary to the law which has been laid down by a two Judge Bench of this Court in Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited v Essar Power Limited10. “2003 Act” 2008) 4 SCC 755 hereinafter referred to as “Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited” 8 Controverting the submissions Mr Sanjay K Agrawal learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent however urged that the decision in Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited would not apply to the facts of the present case since the PPA was executed on 20 May 1999 and the termination by the Board was on 27 September 2001 both of these events have taken place before the enforcement of the 2003 Act on 10 June 2003. It was further urged that the appellant did not raise its objection stemming from Section 86(1)(f) of the 2003 Act when the High Court appointed Arbitrators by the consent of both parties in its order dated21 January 2014 in AC No 711 and also before the Arbitrators so appointed and hence it cannot be raised at this stage. In the present case the notice for the initiation of arbitration under Clause 12.3 of the PPA was issued by the respondent on 30 May 2011. The commencement of the arbitral proceedings by the invocation of the arbitration agreement would therefore relate to 30 May 2011 when the notice invoking Clause 12.3 was issued. Hence the fact that the PPA and the notice of termination predate the 2003 Act would not constitute material circumstances. Section 2111 of the 1996 Act specifies that unless otherwise agreed by the parties the arbitral proceedings in respect of a particular dispute would commence on the date on which a request for that dispute to be referred to arbitration is received by the respondent. Hence there can be no manner of doubt that 30 May 2011 would be the material date since it is on this date that the notice invoking Clause 12.3 was issued by the respondent to the appellant. “21. Commencement of arbitral proceedings.—Unless otherwise agreed by the parties the arbitral proceedings in respect of a particular dispute commence on the date on which a request for that dispute to be referred to arbitration is received by the respondent.” The first issue which is raised in this appeal is governed by Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limitedof the 2003 Act. The Gujarat High Court thereafter appointed an Arbitrator in an application under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act which was impugned before this Court. Speaking for the two Judge bench Justice Markandey Katju settled the position of law in paragraphs 26 27 and 28 of the judgment which are extracted below for convenience of reference: “26. It may be noted that Section 86(1)(f) of the Act of 2003 is a special provision for adjudication of disputes between the licensee and the generating companies. Such disputes can be adjudicated upon either by the State Commission or the person or persons to whom it is referred for arbitration. In our opinion the word “and” in Section 86(1)(f) between the words “generating companies” and “to refer any dispute for arbitration” means “or”. It is well settled that sometimes “and” can mean “or” and sometimes “or” can mean “and” of the Electricity Act 2003 the word “and” between the words “generating companies” and the words “refer any dispute” means “or” otherwise it will lead to an anomalous situation because obviously the State Commission cannot both decide a dispute itself and also refer it to some arbitrator. Hence the word “and” in Section 86(1)(f) means “or”. 28. Section 86(1)(f) is a special provision and hence will override the general provision in Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 for arbitration of licensee and generating disputes between 6 companies. It is well settled that the special law overrides the general law. Hence in our opinion Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 has no adjudicate arbitrate disputes between licensees and generating companies and only Section 86(1)(f) shall apply in such a situation.” This position has subsequently also been approved by two three Judge benches of this Court in Hindustan Zinc Limited v Ajmer Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited12 and NHAI v Sayedabad Tea Company Limited13. From the above judgment it is evident that this Court has held that Section 86(1)(f) of the 2003 Act is a special provision which overrides the general provisions contained in Section 11 of the 1996 Act. Section 86(1)(f) vests a statutory jurisdiction with the State Electricity Commission to adjudicate upon disputes between licensees and generating companies and to refer any dispute for arbitration. The “and” between “generating companies” and “to refer any dispute for arbitration” is to be read as an “or” since the State Electricity Commission cannot obviously resolve the dispute itself and also refer it to arbitration. Section 86(1)(f) is extracted “86.Functions of State Commission.— The State Commission shall discharge the following functions namely: adjudicate upon the disputes between the licensees and generating companies and to refer any dispute for arbitration ” 2019) 17 SCC 82 hereinafter referred to as “Hindustan Zinc Limited” 2020) 15 SCC 161 7 Section 174 of the 2003 Act provides overriding effect to the 2003 Act notwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than the 2003Act itself. Section 174 provides thus: “174. Act to have overriding effect. — Save as otherwise provided in Section 173 the provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than this Act.” We refer now to the second argument raised on behalf of the respondent that the appellant cannot raise an objection relying on Section 86(1)(f) of the 2003 Act in the second application filed by it under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act when it had not raised the same objection in the first application under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act or before the Arbitrators so appointed. It is pertinent to note that this argument was rejected by the Single Judge of the High Court in the impugned judgment and order dated 30 November 2016 in the following terms” “9. I will be failing in my duty if the basic objection raised by Shri Manoj Dubey about maintainability of this application is not dealt with. Merely because in earlier round of litigation the objection of maintainability was not taken it will not preclude the other side to raise such objection if it goes to the root of the matter. This is trite law that jurisdiction cannot be assumed by consent of the parties. If a statute does not provide jurisdiction to entertain an application petition the petition cannot be entertained for any reason whatsoever. Thus I am not inclined to hold that since for the reason that in the earlier round of litigation i.e. A.C. No.76 2011 parties reached to a consensus for appointment of Arbitrators this application is also maintainable. I deem it proper to examine whether because of operation of Section 174 of the Act of 2003 the present application under the Act of 1996 is not maintainable.” 8 A similar issue was raised before a three Judge bench of this Court in Hindustan Zinc Limited where an arbitrator was appointed by the State Electricity Commission under Section 86(1)(f) of the 2003 Act with the consent of the parties. Subsequently the arbitral award was challenged under Section 34 of the 1996 Act before a Commercial Court and the Commercial Court’s decision was challenged in an appeal under Section 37 of the 1996 Act where it was held that the State Electricity Commission had no jurisdiction to appoint the arbitrator since Section 86(1)(f) refers to disputes only between licensees and generating companies and not licensees and consumers. When the matter reached this Court the contention was that the objection to jurisdiction could not have been raised in a proceeding under Section 37 of the 1996 Act once the parties had consented to arbitration earlier. Speaking for the Court Justice Rohinton F Nariman held that if there is inherent lack of jurisdiction the plea can be taken at any stage and also in collateral proceedings. He highlighted the well established principle that a decree passed by a court without subject matter jurisdiction is a nullity and that its invalidity could be set up whenever and wherever it is sought to be enforced or relied upon. Such a defect of jurisdiction cannot be cured even by the consent of the parties. The above dictum would apply to the present case. In the above view of the matter the order of the High Court appointing an arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act is unsustainable. We accordingly allow the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court dated 30 November 2016 in AC No 15. However this will not come in the way of the respondent in taking recourse to such remedies as are available in law. However we have expressed no opinion either on the merits or the 9 objections of the appellant which when urged would be considered by the appropriate forum. There shall be no order as to costs. Pending application if any stands disposed of. ….. …...…...…....... ........J. Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud] M R Shah] Sanjiv Khanna] New Delhi March 23 2021 S \n",

Learned counsel submitted that the case is false also for the reason that there is no injury report of the mother of the informant and as far as the sister of the informant is concerned the injury report shows only one lacerated wound above left half upper lip 1” x 1 2” and no sign of bite was found by the doctor. Thus it was submitted that the injury itself appears to be superficial. It was submitted that the entire family including the petitioners who are female members having clean antecedent have been implicated with ulterior motive and as far as the death of the father of the informant is concerned the assault on him is attributed to the other male co accused and not the petitioners. It was submitted that another aspect of the matter is that in the FIR itself it is alleged that when other male members of the petitioners who are also co accused were assaulting the father of the informant the police had arrived and thus if the same is true then there could not have been any further assault on the father of the informant and Patna High Court CR.

It was submitted that the informant side had blocked the state highway and indulged in brick batting with the police for which Muffasil PS Case No. 1121 dated 23.02.2021 under Sections 147 148 341 323 504 353 332 of the Indian Penal Code was also instituted in which the informant of the present case and others are accused 7. Learned APP submitted that the petitioners are alleged to have assaulted the mother and bitten the sister of the 8. Learned counsel for the informant submitted that the father of the informant has died due to assault. However it was not controverted that the assault on the father of the informant is attributed to the male co accused in the case and not the petitioners and also that there is no injury report with regard to the mother of the informant as also that only a lacerated wound on the upper lip of the sister of the informant has been found by the doctor as noted in the injury report. 9.

No.377321 dt.06 08 2021 the case and submissions of learned counsel for the parties in the tentative view of the Court the allegations against the petitioners who have been made accused along with their other male members are not corroborated by the material brought before the police inasmuch as there is no injury report with regard to the mother of the informant and further that the sister of the informant has suffered only a lacerated wound above the left half upper lip and the petitioners are ladies without any criminal antecedent the Court is inclined to allow their prayer for grant of pre arrest bail 10.

Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the allegation is false and the informant and other girls had taken money to perform in his dance troupe and because they neither wanted to perform nor return the money this false case has been instituted. Learned counsel submitted that as per the allegation itself no wrong act was committed and at best only the informant and the girls were being pressurized. It was submitted that the girls because they belong from outside the State were being kept at the house of the petitioner where they were also being properly taken care of with regard to boarding and lodging.

No.10817 2021Allowed subject to all just exceptions and as per extant Rules. The application stands disposed of. W.P.(C) 3576 2021 & C.M. No.10818 2021The present writ petition impugns the order dated 13th October 2020 passed by Central Administrative Tribunalin OA No.2955 2019. By W.P.(C) 3576 2021 the said impugned order OA filed by respondents no.4 to 31 herein was allowed and the seniority list dated 15th March 2018 which was the subject matter of challenge before the CAT was set aside. The present petition has been filed by the petitioners who were the respondents before the CAT. The brief facts giving rise to the present petition are set out The petitioners herein were appointed as Inspectors in the Delhi Commissionerate of the respondents in the year 2016 under the direct recruit quota. The private respondentswere also direct recruits recruited in the year 2011 in various zones outside Delhi. At their request they were transferred to the Delhi Zone in the year 2014. On 31.07.2014 there was a substantial re structuring in the department resulting in steep increase in the number of posts of Inspectors in Delhi Zone. On account of the increase in number of vacancies the private respondents took a transfer to Delhi Commissionerate from their parent cadre and were placed at the bottom of the seniority list. The petitioners who were appointed on direct recruitment basis against the vacancies for the year of 2014 joined cadre only in the year 2016. On 15th March 2018 the respondents came out with a seniority list of Inspectors in which the respondents herein were placed below the petitioners. The seniority list was prepared on the basis of OM No. 20011 1 2012 Estt.(D) dated 4th March 2014 which in turn had been prepared in terms of the ratio of the Hon’ble Supreme court in Union of India & Ors. Vs. N.R. Parmar & W.P.(C) 3576 2021 Ors. 13 SCC 340. The private respondents made various representations against the said seniority list. The representations not having been considered favourably the private respondents filed OA No.1251 2019 challenging the seniority list of Inspectors as on 31st March 2015 issued on 15th March 2018. On 5th August 2019 the official respondents amended the RRs with regard to promotion of Inspectors to the post of Superintendents. On 16th September 2019 the private respondents withdrew OA No.1251 2019 with liberty to file fresh OA. On 30th September 2019 fresh OA No.2955 2019 was filed by the private respondents challenging the seniority list dated 15th March 2018 from which the present petition arises. The main ground of challenge in the said OA was that the petitioners who had joined the department after the joining of the private respondents cannot be placed above them in the seniority list. Reliance was placed on the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in K. Meghachandra Singh &Ors. Vs. Ningam Siro & Ors. 5 SCC 689 in which the earlier judgment of N.R. Parmar was overruled. The said OA was contested by both the official respondents as well as the petitioners herein by filing counter affidavits. The said OA 2955 2019 was allowed by the Tribunal vide the impugned order and the seniority list dated 15th March 2018 to the extent it placed petitioners who were appointed and joined Delhi Commissionerate subsequent to the date of the transfer of the private respondents was set aside. It was held by the CAT that the petitioners herein who were appointed in the year 2016 cannot be placed above the private respondents who were appointed in the year 2011 and came on transfer to Delhi Zone in W.P.(C) 3576 2021 the year 2014 the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in N.R. Parmar would apply only in the context of fixation of inter se seniority between the promotees on one hand and direct recruits on the other hand on transfer to Delhi Zone the private respondents would be placed in the seniority after directly recruited Inspectors of the year 2014 on the principle that whoever comes on transfer has to take the last place in the seniority in the zone to which he comes on transfer since the petitioners as well as the private respondents were direct recruits the judgment in N.R. Parmarwould have no impact on them there was no basis or justification to place the petitioners who were appointed in the year 2016 above the private respondents in the Delhi zone andthe judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in N.R. Parmar has been overruled by the Supreme Court judgment in the case of K. Meghachandra Singhpromotees of the vacancies of 2014 were appointed on 1st April 2014 cadre re structuring took place in July 2014 which resulted W.P.(C) 3576 2021 in creation of additional vacancies out of which 459 vacancies were available for direct recruit quota and 229 for promotion quota at that point of time 185 applications for inter Commissionerate transfer were pending from different zones to Delhi Zone it was decided that 200 out of 459 vacancies of direct recruits should be filled up through transfer and remaining 259 vacancies were to be filled up through direct recruitment quota the process for recruitment of 259 Inspectors on direct recruitment basis started on 2nd September 2014 on 7th December 2014 240 more vacancies were made available to be filled through direct recruitment quota and 120 through promotion quota the petitioners qualified the SSC CGL) Examination 2014 against the vacancies for 2014 and were appointed as Inspectors on direct recruitment basis in the Delhi zone in 2016 on 15th March 2018 the respondents finalized the seniority list of Inspectors upto 31st March 2015 in which the name of the private respondents was below the petitioners. 10. The learned Senior Counsel on behalf of the petitioners has strenuously argued that the impugned order of the CAT is erroneous as it fails to consider that while preparing seniority list the recruitment year of the candidates is relevant and not the year in which they join the cadre. The seniority list impugned before CAT was prepared strictly in terms of OM dated 4th March 2014 which was based on N.R. Parmar judgmentRecruitment Year would be the year of initiating the recruitment process against a vacancy year W.P.(C) 3576 2021 Initiation of recruitment process against a vacancy year would be the date of sending of requisition for filling up of vacancies to the recruiting agency in the case of direct recruits in the case of promotees the date on which a proposal UPSC Chairman DPC for convening of DPC to fill up the vacancies through promotion would be the relevant date.” respects in all It was further submitted that on the date the said seniority list was prepared N.R. Parmar judgment of the Supreme Court held the field and therefore the seniority list was correctly prepared on the basis of the said judgment. The said judgment was overruled by a three Judge Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme court in K. Meghachandra Singh judgment supra) which was delivered on 13th November 2019 however the said overruling was prospective and therefore seniority already decided in terms of N.R. Parmarwould be protected. Reliance is also placed on the transfer order dated 20th April 2013 in respect of the private respondents wherein it is specifically noted that transferee officers will be placed below all officers appointed regularly to the post grade in terms of para 3.5 of the DoP&T’s OM dated 3.7.1986. The said Clause 3.5 of the OM dated 3.7.1986 is set out below: “3.5 In cases in which transfers are not strictly in public interest the transferred officers will be placed below all officers appointed regularly to the grade on the date of It was further contended by the Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners that if the directions of the CAT are implemented it would also disturb the inter se seniority between the direct recruits and the promotees. In the impugned seniority list direct recruits and the promotees for the W.P.(C) 3576 2021 vacancies have been interspersed and the promotees have not challenged the same. Therefore in terms of the impugned order of the CAT even the said interspersing between the promotees and the direct recruits would go and the petitioners would become junior to the promotees. 13. The official respondents represented by Mr. Gaurang Kanth Advocate have supported the case of the petitioners. Mr. Kanth has placed reliance on para 3.3 of the OM dated 3.7.1986 and defends the OM dated 4th March 2014 in terms of which the official respondents have correctly drawn the seniority list. 14. Per contra Mr. Harpreet Singh learned counsel for the private respondents submits that the petitioners have wrongly stated that the private respondents are transferees. In reality the said transferees are also direct recruits of the year 2011 and therefore have a right to be interspersed with the promotees of 2015. He further submits that the private respondents were placed at the bottom of the promotees and the direct recruits of 2014. Prior to the cadre re structuring the number of vacancies available for Inspectors in direct recruitment quota was only 12. Only after cadre re structuring in October 2014 the vacancies became 561. So cadre re structuring benefitted petitioners also inasmuch as posts for direct recruits increased. Requisitions to fill in direct recruitment vacancy were sent to SSC only after they had joined Delhi Zone. It was contended that the N.R. Parmar judgment was not applicable because the said judgment dealt with seniority between direct recruits and promotees whereas the controversy in the present case relates to seniority between two different categories of direct recruits inasmuch as the private respondents are also direct recruits W.P.(C) 3576 2021 and this fact has been noted in para 6 of the impugned order. He further submitted that when the private respondents joined the cadre petitioners were not even borne in the cadre. He submits that para 3.3 of the OM dated 3.7.1986 is not relevant as same applies only when an employee is appointed by transfer in accordance with provisions of RRs providing for such transfer in the event of non availability of suitable candidate by direct recruitment or promotion which is not the case here. He further states that the seniority position was not settled when the K. Meghachandra Singh judgment was delivered as the private respondents had filed objections against the seniority list of 15th March 2018 and further had challenged the same before the CAT before the K. Meghachandra Singh judgmentwas delivered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court. Therefore it is wrong to state that the seniority position was settled. In rejoinder it has been submitted on behalf of the petitioners thatprivate respondents may be direct recruits but not for the purposes of Delhi Commissionerate promotees and direct recruits sink and sail together and therefore cannot be separated in the seniority list the petitioners who were borne elsewhere have to come after the promotees and the direct recruits and cannot be sandwiched between them the judgment in K. Meghachandra Singhprotected the inter se seniority based on N.R. Parmar(v) when the petitioners applied for transfer there were no posts available under the Delhi Commissionerate and CAT did not examine the aspect of promotees being benefitted at the expense of the W.P.(C) 3576 2021 16. We have examined the rival contentions. It is a matter of fact that the seniority position in the present case was not finally settled when the judgment in the case of K. Meghachandra Singhwas delivered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court on 13th November 2019. The impugned seniority list was issued on 15th March 2018 and immediately thereafter various representations were filed on behalf of the private respondents against the said seniority list. When no response was received on the said representations the private respondents filed the OA before the CAT challenging the said seniority list from which the present petition arises. In fact OA was also filed before the judgment in K. Meghachandra Singh judgmentwas delivered. Therefore it is incorrect on the part of the petitioners to say that the seniority position was settled and therefore the same has to be protected in terms of the judgment in K. Meghachandra Singh judgment had to be applied. The following paragraphs from the judgment in K. Meghachandra Singhmay be referred to: “37. When we carefully read N.R.Parmar it appears to us that the referred OMswere not property construed in the judgment. Contrary to the eventual finding the said two OMs had made it clear that seniority of the direct recruits be declared only from the date of appointment and not from the date of But surprisingly the judgment while referring to the illustration given in the OM in fact overlooks the effect of the said illustration. According to us the illustration extracted in N.R. Parmar itself makes it clear that the vacancies which initiation of recruitment process. W.P.(C) 3576 2021 were intended for direct recruitment in a particular year 1986) which were filled in the next year could be taken into consideration only in the subsequent year’s seniority list but not in the seniority list of 1986. In fact this was indicated in the two OMs dated 7 2 1986 and 3 7 1986 and that is why the Government issued the subsequent OM on 3 3 2008 by way of clarification of the two earlier 38. At this stage we must also emphasise that the Court in N.R. Parmar need not have observed that the selected candidate cannot be blamed for administrative delay and the gap between the initiation of process and appointment. Such observation is fallacious inasmuch as none can be identified as being a selected candidate on the date when the process of recruitment had commenced. On that day a body of persons aspiring to be appointed to the vacancy intended for direct recruits was not in existence. The persons who might respond to an advertisement cannot have any service related rights not to talk of right to have their seniority counted from the date of the advertisement. In other words only on completion of the process the applicant morphs into a selected candidate and therefore unnecessary observation was made in N.R. Parmar to the effect that the selected candidate cannot be blamed for the administrative delay. In the same context we may usefully refer to the ratio in Shankarsan Dash v. Union of India where it was held that even upon empanelment an appointee does not acquire any right. 39. The judgment in N.R. Parmar relating to the Central Government employees cannot in our opinion automatically apply to the Manipur State Police Officers governed by the MPS Rules 1965. We also feel that N.R. Parmar had incorrectly distinguished the long standing seniority determination principles propounded in inter alia Jagdish Ch. Patnaik Suraj Parkash Gupta v. State of J&K and Pawan Pratap Singh v. Reevan Singh. These three judgments and several others with like enunciation W.P.(C) 3576 2021 that under service on the law for determination of seniority makes it jurisprudence abundantly clear seniority cannot be claimed from a date when the incumbent is yet to be borne in the cadre. In our considered opinion the law on the issue is correctly declared in Jagdish Ch. Patnaik and consequently we disapprove the norms on assessment of inter se seniority suggested in N.R. Parmar. Accordingly the decision in N.R. Parmar is overruled. However it is made clear that this decision will not affect the inter se seniority already based on N.R. Parmar and the same is protected. This decision will apply prospectively except where seniority is to be fixed under the relevant rules from the date of vacancy the date of advertisement.” 17. From a reading of the above passages the dicta of the Hon’ble Supreme Court that emerges can be summarized as below: OMs dated 07.02.1986 and 03.07.1986 were not properly construed in the N.R. Parmarjudgment. The said OMs made it clear that seniority of direct recruits had to be fixed from the date of appointment and not from the date of initiation of recruitment process Persons aspiring to be appointed to a vacant post do not have any vested right. Only upon completion of the selection process a candidate becomes a selected candidate and therefore the finding in N.R. Parmarthat the selected candidate cannot be blamed for administrative delay was not correct iii) N.R. Parmar has incorrectly distinguished longstanding seniority determination principles propounded in the following cases: W.P.(C) 3576 2021 a) Jagdish Ch. Patnaik Vs. State of Orissa 4 SCC 456 b) Suraj Prakash Gupta Vs. State of J&K 7 SCC 561 and c) Pawan Pratap Singh Vs. Reevan Singh 3 SCC 267 In service jurisprudence seniority cannot be claimed from the date when the incumbent is yet to be borne in the cadre and therefore norms on assessment of inter se seniority suggested in N.R. Parmar supra) case were disapproved Decision in N.R. Parmar case is overruled however the decision will not affect the inter se seniority already based on N.R. Parmar case and the same is protected. Decision will apply 18. Therefore in our view CAT has correctly applied the dicta in K. Meghachandra Singhcase in the present case and has proceeded to quash the seniority list to the extent it placed the petitioners above the private respondents. The fact that the CAT decision would impact the inter se seniority between the promotees and direct recruits is not the subject matter of the present petition and therefore need not be examined. It is also an admitted position that in the present case requisitions for the appointment of the petitioners were sent to SSC the recruiting authority on 11th February 2015 after the private respondents had already joined the Delhi Commissionerate. Therefore even in terms of OM dated 4th March 2014 the petitioners cannot be placed above the private respondents. W.P.(C) 3576 2021 APRIL 09 2021 19. Therefore we see no merit in the present petition. AMIT BANSAL J. RAJIV SAHAI ENDLAW J. W.P.(C) 3576 2021 \n",

RESERVED ON : 24th March 2021 PRONOUNCED ON : 06th April 2021JUDGMENTfor quashing FIR. 2.The applicant prays to quash the FIRNo.0032 2019 registered on the basis of thereport lodged by Shankar Pandurang Uchit on07.02.2019 under section 306 of the IndianPenal CodeatKannad City Police Station Dist.Aurangabad. 3.Heard Mr.Suvidh Kulkarni thelearned Advocate for the applicant Mr.YogeshBolkar the learned Advocate for respondentNo.2 and Mr.S.J. Salgare the learnedAdditional Public Prosecutor for respondentno.1 State. 4.The allegations averments made inthe FIR in short are that deceased RatanPandurang Uchit was elder brother of firstinformant Shankar Pandurang Uchit. He wasagriculturist by profession. His first wifewas a Cancer patient. She had committedsuicide getting depressed with Cancer ofwhich she was suffering. Deceased Ratan hastwo children born from the first wife. Afterthe death of first wife Ratan performedsecond marriage with applicant on 11.09.2018 as per Hindu rites and customs prevailing in on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt3their community at Mayur Park area ofAurangabad. The first husband of theapplicant had died prior to her marriage withdeceased Ratan Uchit. After marriage theapplicant used to pick up quarrel withdeceased Ratan Uchit frequently on pettyreasons. Ratan Uchit used to inform about thesame to his younger brother i.e. firstinformant Shankar Uchit. On 07.02.2019 atabout 8.30 a.m. when Shankar Uchit firstinformant had been to his field situatedwithin the limits of village Makranpur so asto bring milk at that time his cousinbrother Pandit Uchit informed him that RatanUchit has committed suicide by hanginghimself to the Neem Tree standing on thedyke of their field. Upon knowing the same Shankar Uchit rushed to the aforesaid spotand saw his brother Ratan Uchit hanging tothe tree. In pursuance of the informationreceived the Police reached there removedthe dead body of Ratan Uchit from the NeemTree to which he was hanging and preparedthe inquest panchanama. During the course ofdrawing inquest panchanama along with a CellPhone one suicide note was found in thepocket of pant worn by deceased Ratan. Fromthe contents of that suicide note Shankar on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt4Uchit first informant has realized that hisbrother Ratan Uchit has committed suicide bygetting fed up with quarrels raised by theapplicant constantly. After performingfuneral and last rituals on the dead body ofRatan Uchit one more suicide note leftbehind by him was found kept near a SpeedMeter of motorcycle bearing no.MH 20 DL 1726.The recitals of the said suicide note wereidentical with the earlier suicide note foundin the pocket of pant of Ratan Uchit.According to Shankar Uchit first informant his brother Ratan Uchit has committed suicideby getting fed up with the quarrels beingraised by the applicant frequently for pettyreasons. Therefore the applicant isresponsible for the suicide death of hisbrother Ratan Uchit. 5.Mr.Suvidh Kulkarni the learnedAdvocate while taking us through the FIR annexed to the application vehemently arguedthat only after four months and six days ofmarriage with applicant Ratan Uchit hascommitted suicide. FIR sought to be quashedhas been registered for the offence ofabetment to commit suicide punishable undersection 306 of the I.P.C. The allegations on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt5about abetment made in the FIR are very muchvague in nature. Details of alleged quarrelsdo not find place in the FIR In order tobring home guilt under section 306 of theI.P.C. it is necessary to prove theabetment. Section 107 of the I.P.C. defines`Abetment’. On the basis of the allegationsmade in FIR it cannot be gathered thateither the applicant instigated orintentionally aided deceased Ratan Uchit forcommission of suicide. Allegations made inFIR that the applicant used to pick up pettyquarrels with deceased Ratan Uchitfrequently in any case do not satisfy thedefinition of abetment. When there are noallegations made in the FIR from which it canbe gathered that the applicant intentionallyinstigated her husband Ratan Uchit to commitsuicide and in pursuance of the saidinstigation Ratan Uchit her husbandcommitted suicide there is no propriety indragging the applicant to face the trial which would ultimately result into hisacquittal. 6.In support of his submissions Mr.Kulkarni learned Advocate has placedreliance on the judgment of Coordinate Bench on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt6of this Court delivered in the case of Dilipand Ors. Vs. State of Maharashtra and Ors.{2016 All MR4328}.7.Per contra Mr.Yogesh Bolkar thelearned Advocate strenuously argued thatRatan Uchit had committed suicide only afterfour months and six days of the marriageperformed with the applicant. The applicantis a quarrelsome woman. In a short span offour months and few days of the marriage shehad harassed her husband Ratan Uchitmentally to a great extent by picking upquarrels with him frequently for pettyreasons. The applicant has not seriouslydisputed genuineness of suicide notes leftbehind by Ratan Uchit. Both the suicide notesare identical. The suicide notes and recitalsof the FIR lodged by the real younger brotherof Ratan Uchit show that harassment by theapplicant was to such an extent that deceasedRatan Uchit was left with no otheralternative but to end his life. Nothing onrecord indicating that Ratan Uchit wassuffering from mental disease. The applicantalso does not say so. Ratan Uchit wasmentally and physically fit would not havecommitted suicide unless harassment on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt7ill treatment meted out by the deceased wasof such a gravity which led him to commitsuicide. According to Mr.Yogesh Bolkar learned Advocate the recitals of FIR are prima facie quite sufficient to make out thecase under section 306 of the I.P.C. againstthe applicant. Therefore the application forquashing FIR is liable to be dismissed. 8.Mr.S.J. Salgare the learnedAdditional Public Prosecutor for respondentno.1 State submitted that having regard tothe allegations made in the FIR and recitalsof both the suicide notes left behind byRatan Uchit it cannot be said that the FIRis wholly imaginary. According to Mr.Salgare the investigation is almost completed andthus accordingly prayed for dismissal ofapplication. 9.Practically in all matters underSection 482 of the Code of Criminalprocedure 1973 the accused approaches theCourt on the ground that the FirstInformation Reporton the face of it does not disclose ingredients that wouldconstitute a cognizable offence. Thus theinherent power of the High Court in it’s on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt8jurisdiction under Section 482 is invokedfor seeking the quashing of the FIR. 10.In C.B.I. Vs. Tapan Kumar Singh6 SCC 175 : AIR 2003 SC 4140 theHonourable supreme court has held inparagraph 22 that “The law does not requirethe mentioning of all the ingredients of theoffence in the FIR. It is only aftercompletion of the investigation that it maybe possible to say whether any offence ismade out on the basis of the evidencecollected by the investigating agency.” It isobserved that an FIR is not an encyclopediawhich must disclose all the facts and detailsrelating to the offence alleged to have beencommitted. It requires no debate that an FIRis merely a report by the informant about thecommission of a cognizable offence and itcannot be ruled out that minute details maynot be mentioned. It cannot be ignored thatan FIR pertains to an offence which isalleged to have been committed and theinformant in a disturbed state of mind andshaken on account of a serious offencecommitted approaches a police station forrecording an FIR. on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt911.In the State of Punjab Vs. DharamSingh 621 : 1987 Supp. SCC89 the Honourable Supreme Court held thatthe High Court had erred in quashing the FIRby going beyond the averments to consdierthe merits of the case even before theinvestigating agency has embarked upon thelegal exercise of collecting evidence.12.In Kurukshetra University Vs. Stateof Haryana4 SCC 451 : AIR 1977 SCC2229( a Three Judges bench) the HonourableSupreme Court has observed thus: “It surprises in the extremethat the High Court thought thatin the exercise of its inherentpowers under Section 482 CriminalProcedure Code it could quash andFIR. The Police had not evencommenced investigation into thecomplaint filed by the warden ofthe University and no proceedingat all was pending in any Court inpursuance of the FIR. It ought tobe realized that inherent powersdo not confer any arbitraryjurisdiction on the High Court toact according to its whim orcaprice.” 13.In Geeta Mehrotra and another Vs. on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt10State of uttar Pradesh and another 10SCC 741 the Honourable Supreme Court hasheld that in the absence of any specificallegation and an FIR prima facie indicating no case against the co accused the Court would have the power to quash anFIR.14.In Parbatbhai Aahir alias ParbatbhaiBhimsinhbhai Karmur and others vs. State ofGujarat and another 9 SCC 641 theHonourable supreme Court has laid down theguiding principles to be considered indetermining whether an FIR could be quashed as under: “(1) Section 482 CrPC preserves theinherent powers of the High Courtto prevent an abuse of the processof any court or to secure the endsof justice. The provision does notconfer new powers. It onlyrecognises and preserves powerswhich inhere in the High Court.The invocation of thejurisdiction of the High Court toquash a first information report ora criminal proceeding on the groundthat a settlement has been arrivedat between the offender and thevictim is not the same as theinvocation of jursidiction for thepurpose of compounding an offence. on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt11While compounding an offence thepower of the court is governed bythe provisions of Section 320 CrPC.The power to quash under Section482 is attracted even if theoffence is non compoundable.In forming an opinionwhether a criminal proceeding orcomplaint should be quashed inexercise of its jurisdiction underSection 482 the High Court mustevaluate whether the ends ofjustice would justify the exerciseof the inherent power.While the inherent power ofthe High Court has a wide ambit andplenitude it has to be exercised(i) to secure the ends of justice orto prevent an abuse of theprocess of any court.In the exercise of thepower under Section 482 and whiledealing with a plea that thedispute has been settled the HighCourt must have due regard to thenature and gravity of the offence.Heinous and serious offencesinvolving mental depravity oroffences such as murder rape and on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt12dacoity cannot appropriately bequashed though the victim or thefamily of the victim have settledthe dispute. Such offences are truly speaking not private innature but have a serious impactupon society. The decision tocontinue with the trial in suchcases is founded on the overridingelement of public interest inpunishing persons for seriousoffences.In such a case the HighCourt may quash the criminalproceeding if in view of thecompromise between the disputants the possibility of a conviction isremote and the continuation of acriminal proceeding would causeoppression and prejudice andThere is yet an exceptionto the principle set out in on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt13Propositionsandabove Economic offences involving thefinancial and economic well being ofthe State have implications whichlie beyond the domain of a meredispute between private disputants.The High Court would be justified indeclining to quash where theoffender is involved in an activityakin to a financial or economicfraud or misdemeanour. Theconsequences of the act complainedof upon the financial or economicsystem will weigh in the balance.” 15.In the light of the aforesaidsubmissions made by the learned Advocates ofboth the sides and the crystalised positionof law for invocation of powers under section482 of the Cr.P.C. we have carefully gonethrough the FIR. It is pertinent to note thatthe marriage between Ratan Uchit and theapplicant was the second marriage for both ofthem. It is evident from the record thatRatan Uchit has died due to hanging on thetree only after four months and six days ofthe marriage with the applicant. Theapplicant has not seriously disputed thenature of death of her husband Ratan. Thedispute is only about abetment. It is settledposition of law that intention is theconcomitant of the abetment. Merely for the on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt14reason that details of quarrels alleged tohave been raised by the applicant with herhusband Ratan Uchit have not been given inthe FIR an inference cannot be drawn thatthe alleged quarrels had no nexus with thesuicide death of Ratan Uchit. The allegationsabout quarrels being picked up by theapplicant with deceased Ratan Uchitfrequently are supported by two suicidenotes left behind by deceased Ratan Uchit.There is nothing on record showing that RatanUchit was suffering from any mental diseaseor chronic ailment. When Ratan was mentallyand physically fit he had no reason tocommit suicide unless harassment meted outby the applicant was of such nature andextent which would compel him to commitsuicide. 16.In Dilip and otherstheCoordinate Bench of this Court afterconsidering the various judgments of theHon’ble Supreme Court has held as under : “unless there is clear mens rea tocommit an offence or active act ordirect act which led the deceased tocommit suicide seeing no option or the on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt15act intending to push the deceased intosuch a position the trial against theaccused under Section 306 of the IndianPenal Code in our considered view would be an abuse of process of law.”17.In Dilip and othersaJudicial Officer had committed suicide on histransfer to Taluka place from the districthead quarters by his superior JudicialOfficer. Except the grievance of transfer the deceased Judicial officer had no othergrievance against his superior JudicialOfficer. In suicide note Junior JudicialOfficer who committed suicide has expressedanguish against the Senior Judicial Officer.Having regard to all these facts theCoordinate Bench of this Court had quashedthe FIR. 18.The facts of the case at hand arealtogether different. Ratan Uchit wasmentally and physically fit person hascommitted suicide only within four months andsix days after the marriage with theapplicant and it is alleged in the FIR andtwo suicide notes left behind by deceasedRatan Uchit that the applicant used to pick on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt16up quarrels with him frequently. Therefore he was fed up and committed suicide. In viewof these material allegations made in the FIRand two suicide notes left behind by deceasedRatan Uchit at this juncture inferencecannot be drawn that the applicant did notinstigate her husband Ratan Uchit to commitsuicide or there was no intention behind thequarrels which she used to pick up with herhusband frequently. Only after trial thismaterial aspect can be decided. Therefore itis not proper to quash the FIR gettinginfluenced with the submission that theapplicant had no intention to drive herhusband Ratan Uchit to commit suicide. 19.In view of above we are notinclined to quash the FIR. Accordingly theapplication is rejected.(RAVINDRA V. GHUGE J.)SGA \n",

HARI SHANKAR JUDGMENT28.06.2021 Video Conferencing) This petition has been taken up on mention as listing was allowed in view of the urgency involved. With consent of parties the petition is being disposed of in view of the nature of the controversy. It is not necessary to dwell in detail on the facts. Suffice it to state that Suit No. 82888 2016 had been preferred by the petitioner before the learned Senior Civil Judge Saket challenging the proposal of the DDA to demolish the property of the petitioner located at D 66 3 Gautam Nagar New Delhi. Said suit was dismissed by the learned Senior Civil Judge vide order dated 8th April 2021 under Order XVII Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908. W.P.(C) 6033 2021 Court. The petitioner moved an application for restoration of the suit. However Mr. Dalal submits that as the presiding officer of the court which was dealing with the petitioner’s suit is not sitting the application for restoration has not been listed. Given the present scenario in which the trial courts are functioning only on a virtual and restricted mode he submits that despite his client’s best efforts it has not been possible to have the restoration application listed before the In the meanwhile he submits that his client has been constrained to move the present petition before this Court as the respondents are taking action to demolish the aforesaid property. As such the petition seeks a restraint on the respondents demolishing the property till final decision in SCJ 82888 2016. Mr. Dalal states fairly that though stricto sensu SCJ 82888 2016 does not survive he seeks status quo regarding the aforesaid property till the decision on the restoration application filed by his client. 5. Mr. Dhanesh Relan learned Standing Counsel for the DDA submits that the property of the petitioner has already been demolished though the said assertion is disputed by Mr. Sunil Dalal on instructions. In my opinion the petitioner cannot be subjected to prejudice merely because of difficulty in having his application for restoration listed before the court given the present strained circumstances. W.P.(C) 6033 2021 7. As such without entering into the disputes between the parties on merits I am inclined to dispose of this petition in the following The learned District JudgeSaket is requested to assign a suitable court to consider the application filed by the petitioner for restoration of SCJ 82888 2016 and have the matter listed before the said court on 7th July 2021.

It is reiterated that this Court has not returned any observations on merits on the disputes between the parties. The petition stands disposed of in the aforesaid terms.

      "IN THE CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 000554 0005521 SUMAN DEVI & ORS ….APPELLANTcomplain that the Uttarakhand High Court’s ruling1 regarding their ineligibility for 1By judgment dated 7th July 2017 in Special Appeal No. 156 143 150 2017 and other connected appeals and writ appointment to the cadre of Family Health WorkerAuxiliary Nurse Midwivesand Health Supervisoris erroneous. The Government of Uttarakhand had advertised on 15.03.2016 440 vacancies of FHW Female) and ANM relative to several years’ backlog. The advertisements were challenged as being contrary to the recruitment rules the challenge was upheld by a single judgeand whose decision was affirmed by the The erstwhile United Provinces enacted a law brought into force w.e.f 25.08.1934was brought into force. Its objective was to set up a Central Councilto establish a uniform standard of training for nurses midwives and health visitors. Section 16 of the INC Act enables the council to prescribe curricula for training and conditions for admission Section 10 of the Act enacted that qualifications included in Part I of the Schedule shall be recognized qualifications and the qualifications included in Part II of the Schedule shall be recognized higher qualifications. The text of the provision is extracted in the footnote below.3 Section 11 stated that notwithstanding other laws any recognized qualification 2 United Provinces Nurses Midwives Assistant MidwivesRegistration Act 1934 3 “10.

By Section 11(1 b) any individual not possessing the recognized qualifications could not be enrolled in any State register as a nurse midwife auxiliary nurse midwife health supervisor etc However an exception was made through the proviso for the continuation of those who had been registered prior to the coming into force of the enactment. Section 15 A of the INC Act provides for the establishment of an Indian Nurses Register to be maintained by the council. Section 16 which is important for the purpose of this judgment enables the council to frame regulations the relevant part is extracted in the footnote below.4 The composite State of Uttar Pradesh framed the Uttar Pradesh Department of Medical Health and Family Welfare Health Worker and Health SupervisorService Rules 1997 under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India. Rule 5(1) of the 1997 Rules prescribed that direct recruitment through the Public Service Commission of Health Worker would be from amongst such male candidates who successfully nurses midwives or health visitors for the settling of a scheme of reciprocity for the recognition of qualifications and in pursuance of any such scheme the Council may declare that a qualification granted by any authority in any such territory or country or such qualification only when granted after a specified date shall be a recognised qualification for the purposes of this Act Provided that no declaration shall be made under this sub section in respect of any qualification unless by the law and practice of the foreign country in which the qualification is granted persons domiciled or originating in India and holding qualifications recognised under this Act are permitted to enter and practice the nursing profession in that country Provided further thatany reciprocal arrangements subsisting at the date of the commencement of this Act between a State Council and any authority outside India for the recognition of qualifications shall unless the Council decides otherwise continue in force and ii) any qualification granted by an authority in a territory of India to which this Act did not extend at the date of its commencement and recognised on the said date by the State Council of a State to which this Act then extended shall continue to be a recognised qualification for the purpose of registration in that State 4) The provisions of sub sectionsandand of sections 14 and 15 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the declaration by the Council of a qualification granted in respect of post certificate nursing training as a recognised higher 4“16. Power to make regulations.The Council may make regulations not inconsistent with this Act generally to carry out the provisions of this Act and in particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing powers such regulations may provide for g) prescribing the standard curricula for the training of nurses midwives and health visitors for training courses for teachers of nurses midwives and health visitors and for training in nursing administration h) prescribing the conditions for admission to courses of training as aforesaid i) prescribing the standards of examination and other requirements to be satisfied to secure for qualifications recognition under this Act.” complete the one year basic health worker training course conducted by the departmental divisional training centers of the state. Likewise Rule 5(2) prescribed for direct recruitment through the Public Service Commission from amongst such female candidates who had successfully completed one year and a half year basic mahila health worker training courseconducted by the Uttar Pradesh Nurses and Midwives Council Lucknow. Such candidates also had to be duly registered under the Uttar Pradesh Nurses and Midwives Council Lucknow Rule 8 which is relevant for the purpose of deciding this batch of appeals reads as “Rule 8. Academic qualification A candidate for Direct Recruitment to the post of Health Workermust have successfully completed prescribed training course for Basic Health Workerof the State of Uttar Pradesh ii) A candidate for Direct Recruitment to the post of Health Worker Female) must have successfully completed prescribed training course for Basic Health Worker conducted by the Uttar Pradesh Nurses and Midwives Council Lucknow and is also duly registered in the Uttar Pradesh Nurses and Midwives Council Lucknow Provided that after enforcement of Uttar Pradesh Medical Health and Family Welfare Department Health Workers and Health Supervisors Male & Female) Servicerules 1998 it is necessary that for selection for such training the candidate must pass the Intermediate Examination with Science subject of Secondary Education Board U.P. or any examination equivalent thereto.” The 1997 Rules were apparently amended in 1998. Rule 14 which was substituted by this amendment reads as follows “Rule 14After enforcement of Uttar Pradesh Medical Health and Family Welfare Department Health Workers and Health Supervisors Male & Female) Servicerules 1998 the process of selection of candidates for training as prescribed under Rule 8 as amended from time to timeGroup ‘C’ shall be made under the provisions provided under Direct Recruitment Rules 1998. The number of candidates selected for training would be as per number of Sub Rule at the time of making selection under Sub Section the provisions of reservation shall be followed as prescribed in Rule 6.” In the aforesaid rules in place of existing Rule 15 mentioned below in Columnshall be replaced with the rule mentioned in Column 2.” The State of Uttarakhand was formed pursuant to the re organization of the State of U.P the new state came into existence on 09.11.2000. The laws in force in the erstwhile composite U.P. State were adopted and continued to remain in force in Uttarakhand. Thus the 1997 Rules providing for recruitment of Health Workertogether with the 1998 amendments continued to remain in force in Uttarakhand. In the meanwhile on 02.01.2007 by a notification published in the Central Government Gazette the regulations published by the council under Section 16 of the INC Act were brought into force they stated that the basic educational qualification in order to be enrolled for the Nursing Auxiliary Programme was the Secondary School Certificate Examination. The relevant extract of the said notification is reproduced below “Secondary School Certificate Examination 10th class or central board secondary education or a recognized equivalent public examination. Subjects of study must be equivalents to those prescribed by the CBSE for the Class X with minimum 45%.” The INC again amended the regulations on 21.10.2016. These amendments were made applicable with effect from July 2012. The course was made into a two year course. The minimum qualification provided for joining the course was to be 12 years of schooling. The relevant extract of the said amended criteria is as follows “The minimum educational requirement shall be the passing of 12 years of schooling recognised by CBSE ICSE SSSCE HSCE or a recognised equivalent examination.” It is in this background that on 15.03.2016 an advertisement was issued by the Uttarakhand Government inviting applications for appointment of trained ANMs in terms of the prevailing rules. However the appointment did not spell out that the candidates ought to have finished their schooling with science as a subject. The relevant eligibility criteria in the said advertisement read as follows Candidate must have acquired educational qualifications prescribed by Indian Nursing Council New Delhi Candidate must be registered with Uttarakhand Nurses and Midwives Council Dehradun Photocopies of the statement of marks and the certificates shall be Soon after the advertisement was issued the Uttarakhand Medical Health and Family Welfare Health Worker and Health SupervisorService Rules 2016were brought into force. These were statutory in nature and replaced the 1997 Rules. The Rules significantly amended the eligibility criteria in a graded manner for different years. Rule 8(2) which is relevant for the purpose of the present discussion reads as follows 8(2) Health WorkerA candidate must pass intermediate education of Uttarakhand Board and successfully completed two year course of Basic Health Workertrainingor equivalent recognised qualification by the State Government ii) But for the selection year 2010 to 2013 those applicants who has passed 10th class examination from Board of High School and successfully completed 18 months course of Basic Health Worker Female) training or equivalent recognized qualification by the State Government iii) The Candidate has passed Intermediate Examination of the Uttarakhand Board or any other equivalent qualification in addition to which the candidates must have successfully completed 18 months course of Basic Health Worker Female) training or equivalent recognized qualification prior to the selection year 2010 iv) The candidate must be duly registered in the Nurses and Midwifery Council of Uttarakhand.” 11. Writ petitions were preferred before the Uttarakhand High Court questioning the advertisement and seeking a direction that the recruitment to the extent it was contrary to the rulesbe set aside. A learned single judge of the High Court after issuing notice to the state and hearing the parties allowed those writ petitions. The present appellants approached the Division Bench aggrieved by that decision contending that the advertisement was correctly framed because the INC’s regulations did not require science as an essential subject in the qualifying 10 th standard or 12th standard examination and that they had been registered in terms of the INC’s regulations. They contended therefore that the single judge erred in holding that they were ineligible Contentions of parties It is contended by Ms. V. Mohana learned senior counsel for the appellants that they had qualified in the Intermediate level at the relevant times in Arts. These appellants also underwent the same syllabus and training as the candidates who had passed Intermediate in Science. She urged that rather than requiring that those qualified for admission to the ANM Course should have qualified Intermediate in Science the State should have adopted a rational principle such as inter se merit among the candidates in the completion of the concerned courses. It was urged that that there is no intelligible differentia distinguishing students with Intermediate in Arts and those who have done Intermediate in Science nor is there any rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved. The insistence of the science subject amongst two persons falling in the same class i.e. those who had completed Intermediate and were registered with the INC was discriminatory It was argued that the purpose of every service rule is to provide equal opportunity to all. It is submitted that the result of the statutory rule contained in the proviso limiting the persons qualified to undergo the ANM course to those who have done Intermediate in Science is to offend the right to equality. The result of the rule is that it does not permit a person to work in the State of Uttarakhand as a Health Worker for the mere reason that the person has done Intermediate in Arts. The appellants also submit that there is a legitimate expectation that having completed the course of ANM they would be considered for employment in Uttarakhand given that they were It was further argued that having regard to the provisions of the 1947 Act which is a central enactment traceable to Entry 66 of List I of the Seventh Schedule for the purpose of attaining uniformity in standards of education when the Centre has prescribed a uniform norm for getting admitted to the ANM Course the states cannot prescribe a different criteria for recruitment to their posts or cadres and exclude the appellants who conform to the requirements under the 1947 Act. It was pointed out that regulations were framed under Section 16 of the 1947 Act and that the prescription confining eligibility to those who have completed Intermediate in Science was It was argued that there was no whisper in the impugned advertisement that the 1997 Rules would apply. Counsel relied on Articles 15(2) and 16(2) in regard to the advertisement pursuant to which the petitioners5 appliedand 16(2). It was next argued that even though the rule contemplates training imparted by the Uttar Pradesh Nurses and Midwives Council there was actually no training imparted by the UP Nurses and Midwives Council that training was by some other body. The rule was therefore rendered unworkable. 17. Relying upon the judgment in Desh Bandhu Gupta v. Delhi Stock Exchange6 it was argued that the conditions spelt out in the advertisement as the eligibility norms for purposes of recruitment had to be given effect to. Further relying upon the subsequent decision of this Court in N.P.N. Devin Katti v. Karnataka Public Service Commission7 learned senior counsel urged that the criteria and conditions spelt out in the advertisement would continue to bind the State till the end of the selection or the recruitment as the case may be and any intervening and subsequent change in the rule position would not affect the ongoing recruitment process. It was subsequently urged therefore that since the advertisement was issued on 15.03.2016 the subsequent amendment which came into force on 26.07.2016 could not be made applicable. In short it was urged that the State was bound by the standards it prescribed in this case the conditions spelt out in the advertisement never stated that to be considered eligible 5Who were petitioners in Writ PetitionNo. 6416. 6(1979) 4 SCC 565 73 SCC 157 a qualified and registered ANM should have completed or graduated with intermediate 10+2 examination in the Science stream 18. Other counsel appearing for the appellants urged that some of the appellants had undergone the ANM Course in training institutes in the State of Uttarakhand and others had obtained ANM certificates from different states. It was submitted that the training institutes invited applications and though the appellants had completed Intermediate in Arts they were enrolled on the ANM course which they successfully completed as they did with the training programme. In these circumstances the state could not discriminate against them. It was argued that after having imparted training these appellants could not be denied appointment. 19. Counsel further submitted that the adoption order issued under Section 87 of the U.P. Reorganisation Act 2000 did not expressly refer to the amendment by which the proviso was inserted on 10.09.1998. It was argued that the advertisement prescribed that candidates should possess the qualifications prescribed by the INC which the appellants did. Consequently there could have been no valid basis to reject their candidature It was lastly urged that given that all the appellants had qualified previously and were waiting for selection and furthermore that many persons on the rolls of the government and working as ANMs had not qualified in Science it would be unfair and discriminatory to exclude the appellants and not consider their candidature The learned AAG who argued on behalf of the State submitted that undoubtedly the advertisement was issued on 15.03.2016. He however emphasized the fact that the 1997 Rules as amended in 1998held the field. Repelling the arguments on behalf of the appellants that the U.P. Reorganization Act did not specifically adopt the Rules he urged that there was nothing to the contrary in Section 87 of the Reorganization Act or any adopted order. It was submitted that the Uttarakhand Government had not made any regular selection from inception. Given the position in the recruitment rules registered ANMs who had qualified in their intermediate examinations or school boards in the science stream were alone eligible for consideration. He submitted further that there is no automatic appointment merely on the strength of having qualified in the ANM examination and having undergone the training or for that matter having been registered and that the concerned selection committee constituted under the Rules was under a duty to consider applications on the basis of batch wise seniority and those eligible “in accordance with the Rules” could be recommended for appointment. He relied upon Rule 15 in this regard Learned counsel for the State submitted that for the purposes of recruitment to civil posts or services within the State the state has the competence to prescribe eligibility conditions. The question of the rules in the present case conflicting with the standards prescribed under the 1947 Act cannot arise. It was submitted in this regard that the said enactment sets up the Nursing Council which under Section 16 prescribes the regulations standards which institutions must fulfill in order for their courses to be recognized. However whether the holding of such qualifications per se binds the State to accept them or prescribe additional qualifications or experience for employment within the State is exclusively that of the State’s domain. In exercise of this power the State is competent to prescribe recruitment rules as it did as the erstwhile State of U.P did in 1997 when Rule 8 along with other rules were brought into force and subsequently amended in 1998. That rule specifically stated that apart from completing the ANM course to be eligible for appointment as an ANM in the Uttarakhand Government or its institutions the concerned candidate also should have qualified in the Science Stream at the 10+2 or equivalent level of education. It was submitted that this condition is reasonable and cannot by any stretch of imagination be deemed to be repugnant to the provisions of the 1947 Act. The 1947 Act only applies to standards prescribed by the Nursing Council. That council does not have the competence to prescribe the conditions for employment in any given State It was argued that the applicability or otherwise of the 2016 Rules was neither pleaded nor urged before the High Court. Learned counsel emphasized that a close reading of the said Rules especially Rule 8 would show that prior to 2010 the rule position was that to be considered for appointment as ANM the candidate should have qualified in the concerned course and also graduated with Science in the school board intermediate. For the brief period between 2010 and 2013 the insistence on qualifying in the science stream was relieved and instead of the 10+2 or intermediate qualification candidates who had passed the 10th standard with requisite ANM completion certification and training were deemed eligible. In other words for the three year period up to 2013 a candidate was not required to have qualified in the 12th standard in the science stream. For the period 2013 2016 candidates could apply only if they had an intermediate or equivalent qualification with science subjects together with ANM qualification and training. Only with the advent of the 2016 Ruleswere those with Intermediate qualification not necessarily with science but also qualifying in a recognized ANM course with requisite training deemed eligible. It was argued that since none of the petitioners fell in the category of those qualified between 2010 2013 but rather had completed their Intermediate and the relevant ANM course with training prior to 2010 or after 2013 the question of their being eligible did not arise It was argued that the State could not be faulted nor bound down by the omission to advert to the relevant eligibility criteria in the advertisement. In this regard it was submitted that the advertisement itself spelt out that the concerned recruitment would be in accordance with the prevailing rules8 8The concerned condition in the advertisement reads as follows “7. Selection: Selection on above posts shall be done under provisions of relevant Departmental Service It was submitted that the new rules did not indicate that they were retrospective and consequently could not have applied to the appellants or the ongoing recruitment in which case only could the appellants or some of them be deemed eligible. It was submitted that the entire claim of the appellants were the eligibility conditions specified in para 3 of the advertisement. Lastly it was urged that neither were the rules nor was the advertisement challenged and in these circumstances the question of any condition being discriminatory did not arise Analysis and Conclusions From the above factual narration it is evident that in the present case before the formation of the state of Uttarakhand rules which governed recruitment and other conditions of service in relation to health workers and ANMs had been framed by the erstwhile state of Uttar Pradesh. Those rules were amended in 1998 the result of the amendment to the existing rules was that minimum qualifications of intermediate or equivalent in the science stream were essential for recruitment and appointment to the cadre of Female Health Workers and ANMs. Every candidate of course should have completed the ANM course with the mandatory training nevertheless the educational qualification of having completed intermediate in science was essential. This court finds no merit in the submission of the appellants that the requirement of an intermediate in science stream did not exist since the adaptation order under the Reorganization Act omitted to mention the rules framed by the erstwhile state of UP. Sections 87 and 88 of the Reorganization Act read as follows “87. Power to adapt laws.—For the purpose of facilitating the application in relation to the State of Uttar Pradesh or Uttaranchal of any law made before the appointed day the appropriate Government may before the expiration of two years from that day by order make such adaptations and modifications of the law whether by way of repeal or amendment as may be necessary or expedient and thereupon every such law shall have effect subject to the adaptations and modifications so made until altered repealed or amended by a competent Legislature or other competent authority. Explanation.—In this section the expression “appropriate Government” means as respects any law relating to a matter enumerated in the Union List the Central Government and as respects any other law in its application to a State the State 88. Power to construe laws.—Notwithstanding that no provision or insufficient provision has been made under section 87 for the adaptation of a law made before the appointed day any court tribunal or authority required or empowered to enforce such law may for the purpose of facilitating its application in relation to the State of Uttar Pradesh or Uttaranchal construe the law in such manner without affecting the substance as may be necessary or proper in regard to the matter before the court tribunal or authority.” 27. By virtue of Section 28 of the Reorganization Act9 the newly established Uttarakhand High Court had the jurisdiction powers and authority in respect of the law in force immediately before the appointed day which was exercisable by the Allahabad High Court. 28. A comprehensive reading of the provisions of the Reorganization Act would show that the laws in force in the erstwhile state of UP continued to remain operative upon the creation of the new state of Uttarakhand. Section 87 only had the effect of obliging the state and the courts to thereafter enforce the existing laws to the extent they were modified within a period of 2 years from the date of commencement of the Reorganization Act. If the appellants are correct the mere omission of a law or regulation in the adaptation order would have the disastrous effect of creating a vacuum in regard to existing laws that are not specifically mentioned. In other words the power 928. Jurisdiction of Uttaranchal High Court.—The High Court of Uttaranchal shall have in respect of any part of the territories included in the State of Uttaranchal all such jurisdiction powers and authority as under the law in force immediately before the appointed day are exercisable in respect of that part of the said territories by the High Court at to adapt only meant that such laws which required some modifications or adaptations could be so modified or adapted within the period defined i.e. 2 years. In the absence of any such exercise of adaptation or modification all the laws rules regulations and statutory orders that were in force in the state of UP applied without any change This court holds to be unmerited the arguments of the appellant that the state was bound by the criteria specified in the advertisement issued by it in March 2016 even though Clause 7 of that notification clearly specified that the recruitments for ANMs would be in accordance with the statutory rules. The omission to mention the relevant qualificationsdid not relieve the state from its obligation to follow existing rules. It has not been disputed that the 1997 Rules after amendment in 1998 mandated that candidates desirous of being recruited as ANM or Health Workers had to possess educational qualifications including Intermediate passwith the science stream apart from the necessary ANM certificate course. That condition remained unchanged even after the creation of the State of Uttarakhand. It was only in 2016 after the advertisement for the concerned recruitment was published that the rules were changed the changed new rules relieved the requirement of having to qualify the Intermediate level with science subjects for the period 2010 2013 and thereafter after July 2016. For all other periods the basic educational qualification of intermediate or equivalent pass with a mandatory science stream qualification remained an essential condition. Therefore the argument that the state was bound by the standards it specified4 SCC 18 at the stage of recruitment. That the INC Act allows the council to prescribe standards for education which it legitimately exercises for the purposes of recognizing nursing courses in no way detracts or undermines the authority of the state to prescribe other eligibility conditions which candidates can and should possess as a condition precedent for recruitment purposes in the exercise of its power under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution. As held in Sanjay Kumar Manjul v. UPSC11 “25. The statutory authority is entitled to frame the statutory rules laying down the terms and conditions of service as also the qualifications essential for holding a particular post. It is only the authority concerned which can take ultimate decision therefore 26. The jurisdiction of the superior courts it is a trite law would be to interpret the rule and not to supplant or supplement the same.” Therefore this court perceives no conflict between the provisions of the INC Act and the recruitment rules which were in force in the state of Uttarakhand from the time of its creation in 2000 till 2016 when the rules were changed after the advertisement in question for the recruitments was issued which this court is now called upon to Turning to the appellants’ argument regarding their right to be appointed according to batch wise seniority it is noticeable that by Rule 5 of the old 1997 Rules as amended as well as in the 2016 Rules there is no automatic recruitment the post of Health Worker ANM is to be filled by direct recruitment the selection procedure is as contemplated by Rule 15whereby a three member selection committee would recommend for selection having due regard to the year wise allocation of vacancies persons eligible for appointment having regard to the qualifications held by them by batch wise seniority8 SCC 42 the dates on which training is completed). This mode of selection does not eliminate the requirement of the rule prescribing essential qualifications nor does it relieve any candidate from the obligation to apply for the post and face the scrutiny of the committee for her candidature. In the present case 440 vacancies were advertised they were to be considered together obviously in respect of older vacancies which arose for previous years the qualifications applicable for the vacancy years were applicable None of the appellants disputed that they were ineligible in terms of the old rules as they did not hold the requisite intermediate qualifications in the science stream. The appellants’ contention in this regard too consequently fails In view of the foregoing conclusions there is no merit in these appeals they are dismissed without any order on costs. L.

The police was enquiring againand again about her father namely Parvinder Singh. The Ld. Single Judge concluded that the report ofthe Warrant Officer showed that both the detenues had beendetained in the police station City Ropar illegally withoutfollowing any procedure as per law. Even if it was acceptedthat some persons had tried to cause harm to them even then both of them could not be kept in the police station for two dayswithout even making entry in the roznamcha and also withoutinforming the District Illaqa Magistrate. The detenues had notbeen produced before any Court of law which clearly show on 08 10 CRWP 777 2019(O&M) 3 that they had been illegally detained in the police station toprocure the presence of Parvinder Singh in a murder case. Holding that it was a gross violation of fundamentalrights of the citizens it was opined that action needed to betaken against the erring officials and the detneues needed to becompensated. The matter was referred to a larger Bench forissuing guidelines issuing directions etc. to protect thefundamental rights of the citizens.” 2.In the reply filed by way of affidavit of AssistantSuperintendent of Police Sub division Rupnagar it has been stated that thepolice officers of Police Station City Rupnagar had not illegally detained thealleged detenues. 3.It is stated that on 02.09.2019 one complaint by HarwinderKaurwas received in Police Station Morinda DistrictRupnagar in which she stated that the articles lying in her house were beingstolen by Simranjit Singh Kaka Singh Sodhi Singh etc. On this SISimranjeet Singh along with other officials aforesaid Harwinder Kaur andher daughter Rupinder Kaur went to the spot on his official vehicle PB 12 M6619.

Kolkata Sadar Kolkata …. …. CORAM :HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE GAUTAM KUMAR CHOUDHARY For the Appellants For the Respondents CAV ON 03. 02.2022 : Mr. Mahesh Tewari Advocate : Mr. Anil Kumar Sinha Advocate PRONOUNCED ON 10.02. 2022 This appeal is filed under Section 23 of the Railway Claims Tribunal Act 1987 against the judgement dated 16.09.2009 passed by the learned Member Judicial) Railway Claims Tribunal Ranchi Bench Ranchi in Case No. OR 70011 2007 in favour of respondent named herein directing the appellant to refund Rs. 3 71 328 to the respondents along with interest @ 6% per annum from 01.11.2006 till the date of payment and also cost. The respondent applicant manufactures pretressed concrete sleepers for the Indian Railways. It is the case of the respondent that with the permission of the Railway Board 1240 MT of special cement was purchased from M s. Ambuja Cement Eastern Ltd. This consignment was booked in 20 Wagons. The consignment was loaded from the site of dispatch i.e. Bhatapara and the weight of the 20 wagons was 1241.00 M.T. Before reaching the destination site i.e. Jagadishpur when the consignment was re weighed it was found the net weight to be 1355.40 M.T. In view of the overloading a punitive charges amounting to Rs. 3 71 328 was raised against the respondent. The Respondent moved the Railway claim Tribunal for refund of the punitive charge under Section 16 of Railway Claim Tribunal Act 1987 which has been allowed on the basis of Annexure 5 which showed that weight of the cement was 1224.96 MT recorded by the Chief Goods Clerk MRLB Bhatapara under 2 South Eastern Railways in the presence of the authorized agent of Ambuja Cement Eastern Ltd. The overloading was found en route without notice to the applicant The appellant earlier moved this Court in W.P.(C) No. 274 2009 challenging the order of the Railway Tribunal which was dismissed vide order dated was wrong. The appellant moved the Hon’ble Court in L.P.A No.4910 and their Lordships vide order dated 11.01.2011 were pleased to permit the appellant to withdraw the appeal. It was held by their Lordships that the appellant will have right to move the Appellate forum and if the appeal is filed then question of limitation will be sympathetically considered. The order has been assailed on the ground that punitive charge for the onward distance from Bhaga to Jagdishpur was assessed on the difference between the net weight at Santhaldih weighbridge of 1355.40 and the chargeable weight of It is argued on behalf of the appellant that by the order number RCT DLI Judl.Policy 2002 2003 dated 19.11.2007 of Railways claims Tribunal 13 15 Moldova daily the pecuniary jurisdiction of the concerned single member bench is restricted to ₹ 2 lakhsexcept in untoward and train accident cases. According to the proviso to Section 4(4) of the Railways Claims Criminal Act 1987 the single member should have referred transferred the matter to a bench of two members that he is a division bench when the nature of the matter so demands. Apart from the jurisdictional issue raised it is also argued that there is provision to re weigh and there was nothing wrong on the part of the Railway authorities to have a reweighed the consignment. During rebooking of the consignment from Bhatapara to Jagdishpur the punitive charges were paid by respondent without any objection and without any protest. Once the excess weight had been accepted and got the same rebooked the plea against overloading and consequent punitive charges cannot be raised. It is further argued that in LPA No. 4910 the Hon’ble court was pleased to permit the appellant to withdraw the appeal and the writ and therefore the order passed by Hon’ble. the single Judge in the writ petition does not bar the appellant from preferring the instant appeal. It is submitted by the learned counsel on behalf of the respondent that Hon’ble single Bench in W.P.(C) No. 274 of 2010 by the order dated 8th September 2010 had already confirmed the order of the tribunal and dismissed the 3 As far as the issue of pecuniary jurisdiction of the Tribunal is concerned from the plain reading of the order passed in LPA No. 4910 it is apparent that earlier order passed by the Hon’ble single Judge in W.P.(C) No. 2710 has not been interfered with and therefore cannot be reopened in this appeal. It was held by the Hon’ble single Judge that the issue of pecuniary jurisdiction ought to have been raised at the earliest stage. I also concur with this finding in view of Section 21(2) of the CPC that objection as to competence of a Court with reference to the pecuniary limits of its jurisdiction cannot be allowed in appeal or revision unless the objection was taken in the Court of first instance at the earliest opportunity. 10. Coming to the merit of the appeal the matter for consideration is whether the Railways had the right to reweigh the consignment and whether the necessary procedure was followed. Section 78 of the Railways Act 1989 lays down specific power to reweigh the consignment. The provision reads as under: 78. Power to measure weigh etc.—Notwithstanding anything contained in the railway receipt the railway administration may before the delivery of the consignment have the right to— i) re measure re weigh or re classify any consignment ii) recalculate the freight and other charges and iii) correct any other error or collect any amount that may have been omitted to be charged. From the above provision it is manifest that the Railways was within its right to reweigh the consignment. This extract is taken from Union of India v. Shree Shiv Sai Steel Industries 2019 SCC OnLine Gau 5715 :1 Gau LR 426 :203 AIC9 at page 428 4. A bare reading of section 73 of the Railways Act 1989 would go to show that whenever there is an excess loading of the goods beyond the permissible carrying capacity the railway administration may in addition to the freight and other charges recover from the consigners consignee or the endorsee as the case may be charges by way of penalty on such rates as may be prescribed before the delivery of the goods. The relevant aspect of section 73 is that the recovery of the penalty that may be imposed can be made before the delivery of the goods concerned. The object of having the salutary provision for levying penal charges for overloading has been explained by the Hon’ble Apex Court in Jagjit Cotton Textile Mills v. Chief Commercial Supdt. N.R. 5 SCC 126 at page 147 while upholding the constitutionality it was observed: “42. In our view these contentions are not tenable. As has been noticed in our discussion on Points 1 and 2 the railway statutes define “maximum carrying capacity” “normal carrying capacity”and the “permissible carrying capacity”. 4 No wagon can be loaded beyond the maximum carrying capacity. The wagon could not ordinarily be loaded beyond the normal carrying capacity or up to any upward variation thereof and this limit is called the permissible carrying capacity. Section 73 of the new Act and Rule 161 A of the old Rules permit loading in excess of the permissible carrying capacity without any penal charges now up to a limit of 2 tonnes.What is now subjected to a penal charge is the excess over and above the permissible level above stated which is always below the maximum limit. In our view this levy under Section 73 of the new Act and the old Rule 161 A is intended for dual purposes — one is to see that the gross weight at the axles is not unduly heavy so that accidents on account of the axles breaking down could be prevented. The other reason behind the collection is that inasmuch as the wagon has carried such excess load up to the destination point at the other end the replacement cost of the coaches engines or rails or of repairs to the bridges be covered”. 11. The main ground on which the application for refund has been allowed by the learned Tribunal is that none of the representative were present at the time when the consignment was being reweighed. The impugned order is laconic and has allowed the refund of penalty for overloading merely on the ground that no representative was present. Section 73 specifically provides that the railway administration may reweigh the consignment and recalculate the freight and other charges before the delivery of the goods. During rebooking of the consignment from Bhatapara to Jagdishpur the punitive charges were paid by respondent without any objection and without any protest. In any case when the goods are en route it will be highly unpracticable to detain the consignment until the representative of the consignor comes and presents before re weighment is done. Re weighment is a statutory right of the railway administration to check all short of malpractices and a clog on this cannot be imposed by laying down unrealistic conditionalities like presence of the consignor at the time of reweighment. Considering the length and breadth of our country and the span in which the railways network is spread out is it possible to detain the goods train enroute till the representative arrives there The impugned order does not cite any rule or circular in support of such a requirement. Under the circumstance the impugned order is not sustainable and is accordingly set aside. The appeal is allowed. Consequently I.A. No.4511 stands disposed of. Gautam Kumar Choudhary J.)

      "Non Reportable IN THE CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION Criminal Appeal No. 319 Viram @ Virma .... Appellant The State of Madhya Pradesh …. Respondent W I T H Criminal Appeal No.319 JUDGMENT L. NAGESWARA RAO J. 1. These Criminal Appeals are directed against the judgment of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Gwalior by which the conviction of the Appellants under Sections 147 302 149 325 149 324 149 323 149 and their sentences were upheld. On the oral report given by Solal son of GirdhariFIR No.495 was registered at Police Station Kumbhraj Guna Madhya Pradesh. The informant Solal son of Girdhari stated that Babulal Lodha son of Prabhulal Lodha and Shankarlal had an altercation with Shriram and others during the day time on 19.08.1995. After sunset Shriram Sarpanch Biram 1 | P a g e Devlal Gyarasiram Shrilal Gangaram Kamarlal Ramesh Nathulal Laxminarayan Sholal son of Gopal Lodhi Kanhaiyalal Moolchand Navneet Ram Daula Bhima Hiralal Dhurya Bansilal Hazari Parmanand Bala Bux son of Balram Ram Narayan Lodha armed with farsa lathi ballam spear and sword attacked Shankarlaland Babulal Lodha. The informant along with RodibaiShantibaiPana BaiBabulal S o Girdhari PW 6) Bala Bux Panchulaland Kesharbai PW 9) rushed to rescue Shankarlal and Babulal son of Prabhulal Lodha. Shriram Devlal Gyarasi Shrilal Kamarlal Ramesh @ Barya Nathulal Sholal son of Gopal Lodhi Kanhaiyalal Daula @ Daulatram Bhima Hira Lal Hazari Parmanand Bala Bux son of Balram Ramnarayan Laxmi Narayan and Viram @ Virma assaulted the informant and others who reached the place of incident with farsa spear and sword and inflicted injuries on their heads legs back and other parts of the body. The Appellants were charged under Section 302 and 324 IPC alternatively under Sections 147 302 149 324 149 329 149 IPC. There were a total of 21 accused apart from the two juveniles Ram Narayan and Kanhaiya Lal. 14 witnesses were examined on behalf of the prosecution. 2 | P a g e On a consideration of the evidence adduced by the prosecution the Trial Court held the accused guilty of committing offences under Section 147 302 149 for committing murder of Babulal and under Sections 325 149 324 149 323 149 for voluntarily causing hurt to RodibaiShantibai Pana Bai Babulal S o Girdhari PW 6) Bala BuxPanchulaland KesharbaiSolal son of Girdhariand Shankarlalthe other witnesses reached the place of occurrence after the accused assaulted Babulal son of Prabhulal and Shankarlal. However the Trial Court found that the oral testimony of Shankarlalis creditworthy and there is sufficient corroboration from the ocular evidence of the other injured witnesses. The Trial Court observed that the inconsistencies in the testimonies of the injured eye witnesses are trivial and their evidence cannot be rejected on that ground. According to the Trial Court a cumulative reading of the oral testimony of the injured eye witnesses conclusively proved that the accused inflicted a 3 | P a g e fatal injury on the head of the deceased Babulal. The injury certificates and the oral testimonies of Dr. A.D. Bhindurkar PW 13) and Dr. Sitaram Singhwas scrutinized by the Trial Court and the submission on behalf of the defence that there is a contradiction between the ocular testimony of the witnesses and the medical evidence was rejected. The High Court dismissed the appeals filed by the Appellants by holding that there was no error committed by the Trial Court. The discrepancies in the statements made by the witnesses in Court were held to be minor in nature on the basis of which the Appellants cannot be said to be not guilty The attack made by all the accused on the deceased Babulal and the injured witnesses has been narrated by them in one voice though with some minor variations. DaulalBhimaHazariBala Bux son of BalramMool Chandand Hira Lalhave died. Vanshilal Navneet Ram Dhurya Shrilal Kamarlal Ramesh Nathulal Sholal son of Gopal LodhiViramand Shriramare before this Court in the above Appeals. The Appellants contended that the depositions of all the witnesses is not supported by medical evidence in respect of the nature of injuries number of injuries and the nature of weapons that were used by the accused. Reliance was placed 4 | P a g e on judgments of this Court in Amar Singh v. State of Punjab1 and Ram Narain Singh v. State of Punjab2 to submit that the incongruity in the statements of the eye witnesses and the medical evidence is vital and the accused are entitled for acquittal. The Appellants submitted that only Shankarlal was a witness to the assault on the deceased and all the other injured eye witnesses admittedly arrived at the scene of occurrence later. Therefore their evidence cannot be relied upon by the prosecution to convict the Appellants under Section 302 read with 149 IPC. Yet another point raised on behalf of the Appellants is that the ingredients of Section 149 IPC have not been made out and the Appellants could not have been convicted with the aid of Section 149 IPC. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Appellant contended that in any event conviction under Section 302 149 is harsh and excessive and an alternate conviction under Section 326 149 may be imposed if the Court is inclined to uphold the judgment of the High Court. The case of the prosecution is that interference with the judgments of the Courts below is unwarranted in view of the abundant evidence on record. Shankarlalis an eye witness to the murder of Babulal. The other injured eye witnesses corroborated the statement of PW 11. The 11 SCC 679 24 SCC 497 5 | P a g e inconsistencies and discrepancies in the evidence of all the eye witnesses are trivial and cannot be resorted by the Appellants to their benefit. Though there are certain inconsistencies between the oral testimony of the witnesses and medical evidence the Appellants cannot seek reversal of the judgments of the Courts below in view of the overwhelming oral evidence on record. It is well settled law that this Court does not normally re appreciate the evidence unless the assessment of the High Court is vitiated by an error of law or procedure or is based on error of record misreading of evidence or is inconsistent with the evidence. This Court does not enter into credibility of the evidence with a view to substitute its own opinion for that of the High Court3. Having scrutinised the record of the courts below we are of the considered view that there is no error committed by them. The death of deceased Babulal was caused due to the attack by the Appellants. However the submission of the Appellants that there is a contradiction in the oral testimonies and the medical evidence requires consideration. Shankarlalwho is an injured witness stated that he has seen the accused persons beating the deceased Babulal. According to him Shriram gave a sword blow on the head of Babulal. DhurilalRamesh4 SCC 158 6 | P a g e 9) Bala Bux son of Balramand others gave farsa blow to Babulal. When confronted with the statement recorded by the Police under Section 161 Cr. P.C. the said witness submitted that he had stated to the Police about the aforementioned covert acts and he is not aware as to why this has not been mentioned in his statement. The other witnesses corroborated the statement of PW 11 and also spoke about the injuries caused to them by the Appellants Dr. A.D. Bhindurkar stated that the deceased was brought to the hospital at 03:15 AM on 20.08.1995 and he found the following injuries on his person: 1. “A torn wound in Y shape measuring 8 cm x 1.2 cm x 1.5 cm located on the skin in the region of left parietal bone which appears to have been inflicted by hard and blunt 2. A bluish mark along with abrasion measuring 1 x 0.5 cm · located towards rear side on the joint of right elbow which appears to have been inflicted by hard and blunt 3. A bluish mark along with abrasion measuring 2 x 2 cm below left knee in the front region which appears to have been inflicted by hard and blunt weapon 4. A bluish mark measuring 8 x 3 cm located on left side of chest towards front which appears to have been inflicted by hard and blunt weapon. 7 | P a g e 5. A bluish mark on multiple areas measuring 12 cm x 3 cm located on the back which appears to have been inflicted by hard and blunt weapon.” Dr. A.D. Bhindurkar was of the opinion that injury No.1 was fatal and all the other injuries are simple in nature. He has also stated that the injuries were likely to have been inflicted by truncheon or luhangi. Babulal son of Prabhulal Lodha succumbed to the injuries suffered by him. According to PW 13 the injuries were caused by hard and blunt weapon. Sriram who was carrying a sword RameshDaulal @ Daulatramand Mool Chandwere carrying farsas and Sholal son of Gopal Lodhiwas armed with a ballam. The remaining accused were having sticks in their hands. Apart from some minor aberrations in the testimony of the injured eye witnesses they were consistent in speaking about the weapons that were used by the accused. The oral evidence discloses that there was an indiscriminate attack by the accused on the deceased and the other injured eye witnesses. As found by the Courts below there is a contradiction between the oral testimony of the witnesses and the medical evidence. In Amar Singh v State of Punjab this Court examined the point relating to inconsistencies between the oral evidence and the 8 | P a g e medical opinion. The medical report submitted therein established that there were only contusions abrasions and fractures but there was no incised wound on the left knee of the deceased as alleged by a witness. Therefore the evidence of the witness was found to be totally inconsistent with the medical evidence and that would be sufficient to discredit the entire prosecution case In the instant case the fatal injury was caused by a hard and blunt weapon on the left parietal bone. There is no corresponding injury to the weapons used by RameshDaulal @ Daulatram Mool Chandand Shriram A 20). Therefore the conviction of the Appellants under Section 302 149 is not justified. However there is abundant evidence on record to show that the Appellants attacked the deceased and the injured witnesses with deadly weapons Therefore the Appellants are liable to be convicted under Section 326 read with 149 IPC. 11. The conviction of the Appellants under Sections 325 149 324 149 323 149 is confirmed. We are informed that the Appellants have undergone a sentence of four and half years In the facts and circumstances of the case we are of the opinion that a sentence of seven years under Section 326 149 would meet the ends of justice. 9 | P a g e 12. While upholding the judgment of the High Court regarding the conviction and sentence of the Appellants under Sections 325 149 324 149 323 149 and the sentence imposed for such offences we convert the conviction under Sections 302 149 to 326 149 and sentence from life imprisonment to seven years. Needless to say that we are not expressing any view on the validity of Section 149 IPC which question is left open. 13. The Appeals are partly allowed. [L. NAGESWARA RAO B. V.
